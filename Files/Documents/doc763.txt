            </strong>
            This event was both a social get together for faculty as well as a venue in which to solicit suggestions regarding future directions and programming that FCT might pursue.&nbsp; There were delineated stations that provided aculty opportunities to offer the FCT Board thoughts, wish-lists, and recommendations regarding the future work of the FCT.&nbsp; This information was invaluable for FCT as the organization works to meet a diverse range of needs of individual faculty members, groups of faculty members who work in collaboration, and the institution.&nbsp; Shortly after the event, we provided the faculty with a detailed summary report of the input received and designed several future programs based on this information.

            A conversation facilitate by Jim Peck and Kate Richmond.
            <strong>
             &nbsp;
            </strong>
            Over the last several months, in both scholarly and popular articles, significant attention has been devoted to the issue of &ldquo;trigger warnings&rdquo; in higher education.&nbsp; For faculty who teach courses that include disturbing, controversial or graphic content, &ldquo;trigger warnings&rdquo; (or disclosures that upcoming course content may cause distress) spark debates about perceived changes in the nature of teaching, of students, and of the professoriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; This session gave faculty the chance to discuss recent articles on this topic and share related experiences in Muhlenberg classrooms.

             Stuck in the Middle of the Academic Ladder? --
            </strong>
            Whether a tenured Associate Professor, a recently-promoted Professor, a seasoned Lecturer or an experienced Adjunct, we consider "mid-career faculty" to be those who have moved past the entry/probationary level but are not nearing the end of their careers.&nbsp; Nationwide, many mid-career academic professionals report feeling "stuck" in career phases where they spend increasingly more time on leadership, mentoring, and administrative tasks, and ever diminishing time on advancing their own professional goals, both pedagogical and scholarly.&nbsp; Many, particularly those with family responsibilities, look for a life-work balance in the demanding setting of academic employment.&nbsp; While mid-career faculty often report becoming more passionate about their areas of academic interest, they also report being burned out by the nature of the overall workload.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our conversation focused on issues and strategies for this segment of the Muhlenberg population.&nbsp; What is the situation for mid-career faculty here at Muhlenberg?&nbsp; What challenges do they face and how might those challenges be addressed by the individual and the community?&nbsp; Most importantly, if you are faculty member who is stuck, how can you get un-stuck?

             Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Social --
            </strong>
            This event offered participants the opportunity to learn more about Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL). Muhlenberg College faculty have a long tradition of producing significant scholarship centered around effective teaching and student learning.&nbsp; As part of this social event, FCT invited a few faculty to highlight their recently published work in the SoTL, which recognizes teaching as a serious intellectual activity that encourages innovation, reflection, and the use of evidence-based pedagogies.&nbsp; Faculty participants included:

             Reading the Texts --
            </strong>
            A discussion led by Amy Corbin (Media &amp; Communications and Film Studies), Ioanna Chatzidimitriou (Languages, Literatures, and Cultures), and Margo Hobbs (Art). This session highlighted effective strategies that help students understand what college-level reading requires and how reading a text is shaped by how a group expects to discuss it.&nbsp; We considered a broad definition of "texts" that includes visual art, performances, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;A goal of this event was to help faculty identify and implement pedagogies that encourage students to read texts in meaningful and productive ways.

Have you ever explored ways in which you might work together with students on teaching? Several faculty members (and some of their student collaborators) from different disciplines shared models where they have partnered with students on teaching endeavors.

            - If a product, program, or action is to be labeled as sustainable, it must serve to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is best accomplished by encouraging or enhancing economic development; environmental protection and resource conservation; and human welfare including social justice, community enhancement, and public health.&nbsp;&nbsp;This program explored opportunities to integrate these aspects of sustainability widely across our curriculum including a more in depth look at the new Office of Campus Sustainability and how it can help support teaching.

            -This program offered the opportunity to share strategies and challenges in student preparation, with an emphasis on reading texts. We adopted a broad consideration of the concept of &ldquo;reading texts&rdquo; to include musical scores, visual artwork, etc. Questions discussed included: What are the texts you use in a given course?&nbsp;Do you provide specific guidance to students as to how to read a text in preparation for class discussion, written response, etc.? What does that guidance look like? How do you gauge whether or not (or how well) students have read a text? Handouts:
