            Political Science is a discipline that aims to understand, analyze, and evaluate governmental institutions, public policy, political ideas, and collective action within societies and among nations. By introducing students to the tools of the discipline -- its theories, concepts and research methods -- the study of political science enables students to explore the power relationships, social-economic conditions and ideological commitments that shape political action and public argument in a diverse and globally interdependent society. The Political Science Department takes seriously the mission at the heart of the liberal arts education: cultivating thoughtful, articulate, active, and responsible citizens. In doing so, the Department offers courses and research experiences emphasizing the development of writing skills, critical thinking, and active and intelligent engagement with issues affecting contemporary public life. Political Science students develop an array of skills and experiences that lead to careers in federal, state and local government; international organizations; law; nonprofit organizations and associations; campaign management and polling; journalism; teaching; and graduate study. Students interested in politics and government may also consider several interdisciplinary majors with a substantial political science component. These majors are International Studies, Philosophy/Political Thought, and Political Economy/Public Policy. The department strongly encourages its students to participate in a study abroad experience and a Washington, D.C. or local internship.

             Major Requirements
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The departmental courses are organized into four groups which represent the major subdivisions within political science as recognized by the American Political Science Association: American Government, Comparative Politics, International Politics and Foreign Policy, and Political Theory. Majors will complete a minimum of ten courses in at least three subfields. Additionally, at least one writing intensive course in political science and a minimum of three courses at the 300 level or above are required for majors.

            </strong>
            <br />
            An examination of the philosophical and historical foundations of major political ideologies of the modern era. Students will investigate how ideologies make claims about human nature, history, the state; how they attempt to understand the relationship between socio-economic conditions and the state; how they envision a just political order; and how they prescribe and justify programs of action. Among the ideologies examined: liberalism, civic republicanism, conservatism, socialism, communism, anarchism, nationalism, fascism, Nazism, fundamentalism, and feminism.

             254. Globalization and Social Justice
            </strong>
            <br />
            Interdependence and globalization have brought the world closer to American citizens. As their lives become more inter-connected with the dynamics of international market and political forces, the traditional distinctions between local and global concerns begin to fade. The events of September 11th, wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the cycles of anti-globalization social mobilization have made us acutely aware that national security or national economic prosperity can no longer be conceived apart from the international context. As issues concerning Americans become more &ldquo;intermestic&rdquo;, the avenues and scope for affecting socioeconomic and political transformation also change. The course aims to further student understanding of the complex phenomenon of globalization and its impacts. We will analyze how citizens, as social actors, respond to the new challenges posed by globalization. Students will look at how issues of global socioeconomic and political justice are addressed by various citizen groups, social movements and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in areas as diverse as human rights, environmental concerns, cultural diversity and economic welfare.

            The course will study the development and role of international law and international organizations (the United Nations, regional and functional organizations) in the regulation of interactions among nation-states. The view of Western, communist and less developed states toward these institutions will be examined. The course will focus on issues such as the rights and obligation of states, treaty law, and the role of international organization in maintaining the peace and promoting the improvement of the physical conditions of humankind. Students will be expected to provide brief analyses of hypothetical cases in international law, plus an in-depth analysis of an issue facing international organizations.

             Political Theory
            </em>
           </h3>
           <p>
            Political theory involves the critical examination of the ideological and philosophical underpinnings of political communities, the analysis and evaluation of ideas that animate contemporary political arguments, and the interpretation of classic texts in the history of political theory.

            </strong>
            <br />
            An examination of the major political ideas and ideological arguments influencing the development of political institutions and democratic practices in the United States. Attention is given to the debates leading to the ratification of the Constitution, as well as to important 19th and 20th century political figures and intellectuals who challenged and reshaped our understanding of the Constitution and the American Founding. Consideration is also given to contemporary political thought such as feminism, multiculturalism and environmentalism.

            </strong>
            <br />
            An examination of utopianism and realism as contrasting modes of political thinking. By examining the works of thinkers such as Plato, Thomas More, Bellamy, and Morris, the course will consider the meaning, justifications and functions of utopian thought, both as a blueprint for a just society and a genre of social criticism. The course will consider anti-utopian or realist thinkers such as Thucydides, Machiavelli, and Hobbes who insist on a sober assessment of power as the basis of political and social order. Readings will be drawn from classic texts in political philosophy and literature, as well as contemporary representatives of utopian and realist thought.

            </strong>
            <br />
            This course considers how ideas about the use and meaning of public space &ndash; such as neighborhoods, city streets, marketplaces, parks, public monuments -- frame political conflicts on issues such as social justice, environmental protection, and historical preservation. We examine how laws, socio-economic forces, and cultural values give shape to public spaces, and how such spaces are transformed by the political struggles over their access, control and meaning. We consider questions such as: What is public space? How is it constructed, interpreted, and contested? Who defines the boundaries between public space and private property? Who has the right to access public space? What forms of participation and identity emerge in the contests over public space? We also consider how social-economic forces such as suburbanization, globalization and privatization are reshaping public space.

            This course examines important contributions to the meaning and practice of democracy drawn from both classic and contemporary sources, including representatives of the liberal, communitarian, civic republican, and Marxists traditions of thought. Among the issues considered are the nature and scope of democratic citizenship; the forms of participation; civic education; deliberation and representation; issues of identity and difference; the social and economic conditions needed for democratic politics; and the structure of democratic institutions.

             450. CUE Seminar: Modernity &amp; Its Discontents
            </strong>
            <br />
            Does modernity have a future? Modern liberalism, socialism, and communism grew out of the Enlightenment faith in progress, reason and emancipation, each promising an expansion of freedom and equality through the human mastery of nature. Yet the catastrophes of the 20th century have revealed darker forces at work in the modern era: world wars, alienation, totalitarianism, genocide, environmental deterioration, and terrorism. This seminar considers those political and social critics who offer both a diagnosis of and a cure for of modernity&rsquo;s discontents. Thinkers may include Nietzsche, Marx, Henry Adams, Freud, Max Weber, Arendt, Marcuse and Foucault.
