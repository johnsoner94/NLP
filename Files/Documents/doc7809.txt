                      Affectional Orientation: -
                     </strong>
                     A recent term used to refer to variations in object of emotional and sexual attraction. The term is preferred by some over "sexual orientation/gender identity" because it indicates that the feelings and commitments involved are not solely (or even primarily, for some people) sexual. The term stresses the affective emotional component of attractions and relationships, including heterosexual as well as LGBTQ orientation.

                      Gay -
                     </strong>
                     a) The adjective used to describe people whose enduring physical, romantic, emotional and/or spiritual attractions are to people of the same sex (e.g.,
                     <em>
                      gay man, gay people
                     </em>

                     (n.) is often a preferred term for women. Avoid identifying gay people as "homosexuals".
                     <br />
                     b) Preferred by most homosexual men, this term was adopted by the community to indicate pride. Gay is sometimes used to refer to lesbians and bisexuals as well, but many members of both groups object to this usage, feeling it renders them invisible.

                      Gender -
                     </strong>
                     a) The psychological and social meanings attached to being biologically "male" or "female" by society; this binary system ignores the broad range of genders that exist but do not fall neatly into one of those two categories.
                     <br />
                     b) 1. A socially constructed system of classification that ascribes qualities of masculinity and femininity to people. Gender characteristics can change over time and are different between cultures. Words that refer to gender include: man, woman, transgender, masculine, feminine, and gender queer; 2. One's sense of self as masculine or feminine regardless of external genitalia. Gender is often conflated with sex. This is inaccurate because sex refers to bodies and gender refers to personality characteristics. (see also,

                      Gender identity -
                     </strong>
                     a) Our innermost concept of self as &ldquo; male&rdquo; or &ldquo;female&rdquo;&mdash;what we perceive and call ourselves. Individuals are conscious of this between the ages of 18 months and 3 years. Many people develop a gender identity that 'matches' their biological sex. For some, however, their gender identity is different from their biological sex. (see also:
                     <em>
                      transgender

                     ).
                     <br />
                     b) The gender that one sees oneself as. This can include refusing to label oneself with a gender. Gender identity is also often conflated with sexual orientation, but this is inaccurate. Gender identity does not cause sexual orientation. For example, a masculine woman is not necessarily a lesbian.

                      Gender neutral -
                     </strong>
                     a) Individuals: This can be a person's gender identity, in which the person identifies as having a neutral gender (blending or balancing aspects of different genders) or not identifying with any gender (not male or female, perhaps not transgender either). It can also refer to a person's style of dress, appearance, or gender presentation.
                     <br />
                     b) Language: Nondiscriminatory language to describe relationships (e.g. 'spouse' and 'partner' are gender-neutral alternatives to the gender-specific words 'husband' and 'wife'), and language that can be appropriately used to refer to more than one gender (e.g., 'Police officer' or 'Congressperson' instead of 'policeman' and 'congressman'). Gender neutral pronouns are pronouns that neither reveal nor imply the gender or sex of a person (as opposed to gender-specific pronouns like 'she', 'he', 'her' and 'his'). While these exist in many languages (Traditional Chinese does not use gendered pronouns), there are no universally accepted gender-neutral pronouns in English. Two that have come into use, especially in the trans community, are 'ze' (or 'zie') for she/he, and 'hir' for his/her. (See

A political statement, as well as a sexual orientation, which advocates breaking binary thinking and seeing both sexual orientation and gender identity as potentially fluid (able to change or shift back and forth over time); 3. A simple label to explain a complex set of sexual behaviors and desires. For example, a person who is attracted to multiple genders may identify as queer;

                     </strong>
                     a) An umbrella term for transsexuals, cross-dressers (transvestites), transgenderists, gender queers, and people who identify as neither female nor male and/or as neither a man or as a woman. Transgender is not a sexual orientation; transgender people may have any sexual orientation. It is important to acknowledge that while some people may fit under this definition of transgender, they may not identify as such.
                     <br />
                     b) Transgender (sometimes shortened to trans or TG) people are those whose psychological self ("gender identity") differs from the social expectations for the physical sex they were born with. To understand this, one must understand the difference between biological sex, which is one's body (genitals, chromosomes, ect.), and social gender, which refers to levels of masculinity and femininity. Often, society conflates sex and gender, viewing them as the same thing. But, gender and sex are not the same thing. Transgender people are those whose psychological self ("gender identity") differs from the social expectations for the physical sex they were born with. For example, a female with a masculine gender identity or who identifies as a man.

                     </strong>
                     Term adopted by the Native LGBT Two Spirit community for persons claiming both sexes or genders. In many Native American tribes these are spiritual leaders, healers and teachers, and are very special people in their tribes, very respected and very much leaders. More than 160 tribal languages have terms for men who live as women and/or women who live as men. This phenomenon was driven underground by the negativity of Western culture toward this kind of behavior, and particularly by the attempts by missionaries and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to destroy the Native culture and replace it with Western values.
