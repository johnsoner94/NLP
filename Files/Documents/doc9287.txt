                 Carson D. Schneck
                </strong>
                received a B.S. degree from Muhlenberg College in 1955 and M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Temple University in 1959 and 1965. He served on the faculty of Temple Medical School from 1960-2012 with joint appointments in the departments of anatomy and diagnostic imaging. He was elected to the AOA Honorary Medical Fraternity in his junior year in medical school.
               </p>
               <p>
                As a faculty member, Schneck received 18 Golden Apple Teaching awards, four Medical Yearbook dedications, four Sowell Teaching awards and was selected by 28 medical classes to be a hooder at their graduations. In 1988, he received the Temple Great Teachers award in its inaugural year and the AOA-AAMC Distinguished Basic Science Teacher award as the first recipient of this national award. He also received the Temple Medical Alumni Achievement award and the Stauffer award for Distinguished Service to Temple University. The anatomy lab in the new Medical School Building was dedicated to and largely designed by Schneck. Upon his faculty appointment, in addition to teaching in first year anatomy courses, Schneck initiated PGME and CME clinical anatomy courses in essentially all of the clinical departments and senior medical student elective courses in all of the medical specialties
               </p>
               <p>
                Even though medical basic courses were classically lecture/lab courses, because Schneck had been impressed by the Socratic dialogue style of teaching of philosophy Professor Russell Stine at Muhlenberg College, when he was appointed director of the gross anatomy course in 1969, the anatomy department decided to eliminate all lectures and replace them with clinical problem solving conferences that immediately followed the dissected anatomy. Schneck wrote anatomy notes containing considerable clinical applications of the anatomy. Actual clinical cases were selected from the Diagnostic Imaging library and scripted Power Point presentations of the history, physical, imaging and laboratory findings were shown and the students were all called on individually in problem-solving conference to use their just learned anatomy to solve real clinical problems at the very beginning of their medical education. Temple medical students have consistently evaluated the gross anatomy course as the best basic science course for the past 40 years.
               </p>
               <p>
                In research, Schneck published 30 peer reviewed articles in clinical journals mostly involving MRI imaging of musculoskeletal pathology. He wrote 22 books, monographs and chapters on similar topics. He also produced 18 hours of videotape dissection directions and 20 hours of commercially marketed videotapes that correlated sectional anatomy of the entire body with CT and ultrasound images.
