          </strong>
          <br />
          This procedure establishes the minimum requirements for the lockout of energy isolating devices whenever maintenance or servicing is done on machines or equipment in which the unexpected energization of start up of the machine or equipment, or release of stored energy could cause injury to employees. It shall be used to ensure that the machine or equipment is stopped, isolated from all potentially hazardous energy sources and locked out before employees perform any servicing or maintenance where the unexpected energization or start-up of the machine or equipment or release of stored energy could cause injury.

           All employees are required to comply with the restrictions and limitations imposed upon them during the use of lockout. The authorized employees are required to perform the lockout in accordance with this procedure. All employees, upon observing a machine or piece of equipment which is locked out to perform servicing or maintenance shall not attempt to start, energize or use that machine or equipment. Compliance to this procedure is mandatory any and all individuals who are found not to be following the recommended guidelines are subject to disciplinary action.

           - As an authorized employee, they are instructed of each type of energy source a machine uses, potential hazards and methods or means to control any hazards. Notify affected employees that work requiring lockout/tagout will be performed.
          </li>
          <li>
           <em>
