              </strong>
              Students are accountable for any violation of Muhlenberg&rsquo;s community of responsibility standards as set forth in Section 2.0 of this Code. The Code applies to conduct occurring on College owned or managed property, at College sponsored activities on or off-campus, including off-campus study programs. The College also reserves the right to hold students accountable for any violations of the Code or of local, state, or federal law that occur off-campus.

               3.2
              </strong>
              The Code applies to students from the time they matriculate until they have completed the required units, applied for candidacy, and received their diplomas, unless their enrollment at the College is terminated for other reasons.

              </strong>
              The Code applies to both individuals and groups and student groups and organizations may be charged with violations of this Code. In the event that an incident occurs which clearly implicates a group of students or a student organization, the matter may be considered corporate and each member of the group and/or the group itself may be held responsible.
             </p>
             <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
              a. A student group or organization and its officers may be held collectively and individually responsible when violations of this Code by those associated with the group or organization (i) have received the consent or encouragement of the group or organization or of the group's or organization's leaders or officers; or (ii) have occurred with the knowledge of the group or organization or of the group&rsquo;s or organization&rsquo;s leaders or officers.

             <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
              b. The officers or leaders of a student group or organization may be directed by the Dean of Students to take appropriate action designed to prevent or end violations of this Code by the group or organization. Failure to make reasonable efforts to comply with the Dean's directions shall be considered a violation of this Code, both by the officers or leaders of the group or organization and by the group or organization itself.

             <p style="padding-left: 30px;">

             <p>
              Activities of students may, upon occasion, result in violation of law, and in such cases students are responsible for their actions and any consequences incurred with authorities outside the College. When student behavior is in violation of law and of this Code, the College reserves the right to administer disciplinary action independent of any action by civil or governmental agencies. Disciplinary action at the College will normally proceed while criminal charges are pending and will not be subject to challenge on the ground that criminal charges involving the same incident have been dismissed or reduced. However, the College may elect, considering the circumstances of the case, to delay on-campus disciplinary action pending the resolution of criminal charges.

             <p>
              Student conduct standards at the College should not be equated to state or federal criminal codes. Even in cases involving suspension or expulsion, the aims of the College include education and student development as well as a just punishment. Consequently, College disciplinary policies and procedures--grounded in fundamental fairness--are focused on truth-seeking, and are not adversarial procedures. The College conducts investigatory proceedings and conferences, not trials.

All other alleged violations will be referred directly to the Hearing Board for adjudication as set forth in Sections 19.0 and 20.0 of this Code. The Student Conduct Officer may, in his or her discretion, defer proceedings for alleged minor violations of this Code for a period not to exceed ninety days.

              The College may place a temporary hold on the release of student transcripts in pending disciplinary cases. Students found to have violated the Social Code and who are expelled from the College in connection with a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense shall have the notice of &ldquo;Expulsion&rdquo; and the effective date of the expulsion placed upon their academic transcript. In addition, to the extent permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and other applicable law, the College reserves the right to have the notice of &ldquo;Expulsion&rdquo; and the effective date of the expulsion placed upon a student&rsquo;s academic transcript in connection with other disciplinary matters that result in a student being expelled from the College.

The student must provide written notification to the Student Conduct Officer of the intent to have an attorney present at least 24 hours prior to the Hearing.
