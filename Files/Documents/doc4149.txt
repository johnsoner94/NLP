        A Well-Deserved Break
       </div>
       <p>
        Blog post #4, and Happy Thanksgiving! The cast of
        <i>
         Salome
        </i>
        is currently enjoying a
well-deserved break, but after a remarkably productive first weekend of tech.
Honestly, I am so amazed at how much more a show comes together at the
introduction of a set, lighting, and sound, and our first costume-run is on
Sunday. The decadence of the set, and the elaborateness of the scenic design
has really stream-lined the whole process, and the transition from the
rehearsal room to the stage has been great. The rake of the stage has taken
some getting used to, and some reworking of the blocking, but after last
Sunday, we&rsquo;ve found just how much of a show we have on our hands. I believe
just recently we surpassed fifty rehearsals, which attests just how much work
has gone into this one-act. It&rsquo;s wild to think that
        <i>
         Salome
        </i>
        opens in less than a week now, but given that almost all of
the tech work is done, we&rsquo;ve all got our fingers crossed for the best of runs.
I know this post is a little shorter than the ones in the past, but anticipate
my fifth and final post post-opening. Otherwise, the long hours of tech are
going well, productivity is at an all-time high, and
        <i>
         Salome
        </i>
        is going to be a show with wonderful and relevant subtext,
and performed beautifully by an array of fabulously empowered women. Buy your
tickets, we open Wednesday, November 30!

        The Process
       </div>
       <p>
        Here goes my third blog
post! As
        <i>
         Salome
        </i>
        runs about 2 weeks
from tech, things are stringing together gradually, but progress is being made.
As things are becoming more detailed, things have begun to move slower, but
with more attention to ensemble work, and specificity of motion. Beth Schachter
has been sitting in on our rehearsals lately, and has been a firm advocate for
us to all expand our arms, and take up space, as corresponding to our
respective characters. While at first the focus on arms felt awkward and
over-the-top, we have all conclusively found that the usage and mobility of our
full body expands the status and significance of our motions and
characterizations. I do wish we could expedite the process so that the final
product would be visible ASAP, but the process is probably the most beneficial
aspect of it, however it seems so gruesome right now. The nit-picky repetition
is a little hard, but hopefully the end product will be something I am proud to
be a part of. As a cast, we do have a habit of distraction, which can be fun,
but also a bit taxing at points, because it elongates the fluidity and flow of
things, which we&rsquo;re sort of running out of time to do.
        <i>
         Salome
        </i>
        as a whole is a very ambitious project, what with the
heightened text and usage of an ensemble, but the sense of camaraderie is a
really nice aspect of it. However, I do wish currently we were buckling down
and paying attention to the text, and were truly present during rehearsals, so
as to capitalize on the four hour rehearsals we endure. There is a little bit
of frustration joined with this part of the process, which is the real testing
point of whether the show is going to come together or not. However, I still
think we have a strong show on our hands, we just need to regroup, and really
commit to characterization, text, and status/relationships. Progress, albeit
hard, is being made.

       <p>
        Hi guys, it&rsquo;s Evan Plaza back at it again with another blog post! &nbsp;So we have just closed our Mainstage Production of The Pirates of Penzance. &nbsp;We have put on this show 8 times, from October 28
        <sup>
         th
        </sup>
        to November 6
        <sup>
         th
        </sup>
        . &nbsp;I am not gonna lie, it seems weird to now have free time in my schedule again. &nbsp;I felt like after we had closed the show, I was thinking about the next day when we had to go to call time tomorrow and get ready. &nbsp;This show was my first Mainstage production, and I felt like I have learned so much from this experience. &nbsp;I have learned what it is like to rehearse a show in a month and a half&rsquo;s worth of time, and how valuable that time is to the production. &nbsp;The rehearsal process is so special to any production because it is where the actors get to play and the show begins to mold itself together like a refined sculpture. &nbsp;Having this time determines many things about a show: the tone, the flow, and can even define the overall message that the show is trying to portray. &nbsp;During this process I also learned an essential skill that every actor, better yet, every person, should learn: how to be professional. &nbsp;This show required an amount of time to put together, the time needed to explore and create art determines the success of the show. &nbsp;Having said that, it is important to be punctual, and come prepared to create the art. &nbsp;It is also important to be patient and to come with different ideas to the show; some choices might not fit with the director&rsquo;s vision, or just don&rsquo;t correlate with the characters in the show. &nbsp;I am so grateful I got the opportunity to work on this production alongside a loving and supporting cast. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s all for now, I&rsquo;ll see you next time!

        This is Evan Plaza! I&rsquo;m a sophomore business and theatre double major with concentrations in acting and marketing. I&rsquo;m making my Mainstage debut in our production of Pirates of Penzance as a Pirate ensemble member. Since I have not been in a Mainstage before, this has been an eye-opening experience for me. &nbsp;I have come to enjoy being able to perform alongside such talented people, some being my close friends. While being in rehearsals for a Mainstage, I have realized that there needs to be a level of time commitment in order to deliver a thrilling performance. &nbsp;I always love watching my fellow cast members deliver hilarious yet outstanding numbers at rehearsal. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve always found the process to be the greatest thing about being in a production, because it&rsquo;s where an actor really gets to experiment with the play. &nbsp;I think that this show will make people laugh out loud because of the hilarious choices that the actors in this production have made. &nbsp;Every time we run the show I always find something new to laugh at. &nbsp;We have been in tech now for a while, and it makes me even more excited to be a part of this show and to open it very soon as well! &nbsp;We are beginning to run the show with our different sets and our costumes. &nbsp;I audibly gasped the first time I saw the sets for our show. &nbsp;Yesterday we began running the show in our costumes, and everybody looks amazing in them! &nbsp;Today we begin rehearsing with our orchestra, and I can&rsquo;t wait. &nbsp;I will be posting about my other great things happening in the show in the near future, so stay tuned and make sure to buy a ticket!

        Climbing Over a Rocky Mountain
       </div>
       <p>
        Hi! I&rsquo;m
Jonathan, and I&rsquo;m a freshman with an intended double major in theatre and
something else yet to be determined. As a member of the ensemble, I&rsquo;m one of
your correspondents for a look inside life during
        <i>
         The Pirates of Penzance
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Since our
first rehearsal now 8 weeks ago (it seems like yesterday!), we&rsquo;ve been singing,
dancing and, for all the daughters, &ldquo;climbing over rocky mountains.&rdquo; As we lead
into tech week, we&rsquo;ve been getting accustomed to our two larger-than-life sets
designed by Curtis, as well as the many mismatched, colorful costumes.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Tuesday,
we will be running the show with the orchestra for the first time. It seems
like there isn&rsquo;t an hour passed where one of us isn&rsquo;t drinking throat coat,
steaming or chewing a vitamin in order to keep our voices strong. Despite its
unconventionality,
        <i>
         The Pirates of
Penzance
        </i>
        is still an opera which requires our voices to be at their best &mdash;
especially since there will be no mics. If anything, the Pirates cast really
knows how to fight against the Muhlenberg plague!
       </p>
       <p>
        Personally,
I have had a blast being a part of this show. I greatly anticipate our opening,
and hope that each audience feels the comedy and energy of both casts. With a
cast of more than fifty people, an orchestra with over twenty pieces, this show
promises to be a good one. I&rsquo;ll be sharing more experiences in later
installments, but I can&rsquo;t wait to see you there!

        Discovering the Power Dynamic
       </div>
       <p>
        Hello!
So, this is my second post about the mainstage
        <i>
         Salome,
        </i>
        and things are undergoing some pretty significant changes.
A week or so ago, we had our first designer run, and decided to redo and revamp
some of the scenes. We had Beth Schachter sit in on
some of our rehearsals and play status games with us, so that the cast could
get acquainted with the idea of power. Since the show plays with such
power-heavy scenes, the establishment was necessary. Not to mention the really
interesting power dynamics between characters, some as stark as queen to
servant. Playing with status is helpful to establish relationships with
characters you interact mostly with. The only character in which I have
dialogue with is Salome, and exploring the tension between a princess and a
prophet is very complicated, because one is important on the earthly realm,
which is respected by her subordinates, while the other is a vessel of God, but
is not necessarily respected by those around her. Interacting with the
different actors on stage while playing such a high status is really intriguing
because their reaction is indicative of how high my status is. It affects the
way I hold myself, the way I speak, the fluidity of my motion, etc. Exploring
these differences attunes you to those around you, which is so incredibly helpful
in establishing a character, and its significance. That&rsquo;s not to say that only
those of high status matter in a play. The reality of a production stems from
the reactions of all characters with each other, regardless of status. Status
merely acts as a guideline so that a servant doesn&rsquo;t challenge someone of a
higher status unjustly, or a high status character is inconsistent in their
treatment of those below them. But competing with someone of the same status is
where things really get interesting. The time in which you feel out your sense
of power is different; it&rsquo;s slower and more deliberate. You&rsquo;re more cautious of
your actions, and how the other person is receiving them. I still don&rsquo;t have
everything figured out about the status in
        <i>
         Salome
        </i>
        ,
but I really look forward to continuing the push-and-pull process.

        Empowering Females
       </div>
       <p>
        So, I guess I should start off with a sort of
introduction. My name is Julia, I&rsquo;m a sophomore at Muhlenberg College, and I am
playing Iokanaan in the upcoming production of
        <i>
         Salome
        </i>
        by Oscar Wilde, a part of the second set of New Visions
festival, Falling. We&rsquo;ve been in rehearsal for a little over a month now, and
honestly, I&rsquo;m beyond excited about the cast, the process, and working with a
student director on a Mainstage production. Since the show is gender-bent, and
consists entirely of girls, the dynamic of the rehearsal process is actually
very different from any experiences that I&rsquo;ve had in the past. Personally,
given the sexual connotations of the piece, it&rsquo;s actually been pretty amazing
working with a group of extremely empowered, fluid actresses who are very
supportive of one another. Since the entire cast is comprised of women, the
idea of sexuality isn&rsquo;t projected as a hindrance, but instead, it&rsquo;s more used
as an empowering reclamation of the female form.
        <i>
         Salome
        </i>
        is movement-based, and watching my cast mates partake in a
powerful, highly sexual dance is actually really remarkable. There&rsquo;s no real
strive to fulfill the male gaze in rehearsal; the work is entirely that of the
actresses. It even alleviates some of the stress of appearing &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; on stage,
because the movement is so freeing and strong, really reiterating the concept
that sexuality is not dependent on the perception of men, but instead a means
of self-identity and establishment. The movement of the female form is that of
grace and poise, not of showcasing its assets. I&rsquo;ll be submitting posts on a
roughly 2 week basis, so stay tuned!

        &ldquo;Or,&rdquo; is really Something!
       </div>
       <p>
        <br />
        Hi again! &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve just opened a fantastic new show at Hedgerow Theatre called Or, (the comma is part of the title) and I&rsquo;m going to tell you all about it. &nbsp;(Brief refresher: I&rsquo;m Allie, I graduated in &lsquo;14 and I&rsquo;m working in Philadelphia as a company member at Hedgerow Theatre) &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an amazing, complicated, fast and sexy piece. &nbsp;Summing it up is a bit tricky but here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got. &nbsp;Aphra Behn, the world&rsquo;s first female playwright, has been a spy for the British Crown. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s returned home to her beloved London, still ragged with the great fire, to finally achieve her dream of theatrical renown. &nbsp;However, it&rsquo;s not an easy feat. &nbsp;Not only is she juggling writing a five act play in one night, she&rsquo;s also got her ex-lover-current-spy William threatening a dastardly plot, her current lover King Charles the Second determined to love, and a potential new lover, the young actress Nell Gwynne who wants to meet Charles. &nbsp;Throw in a couple cranky crazy ladies and that&rsquo;s at least a start.
        <br />
        As soon as I was handed this script I fell in love. &nbsp;Not only has Or, been fun, it&rsquo;s a play that I feel really gives the artists behind a chance to say something. &nbsp;Written by Liz Duffy Adams in the late 2000&rsquo;s, this 1660&rsquo;s bedroom farce is surprisingly modern. &nbsp;Yes everyone wears a ridiculous amount of ruffles, and don&rsquo;t get me started on the wigs, but it could be taking place today. &nbsp;Aphra fights for her own happiness against all too recent extreme confines of the Puritanical rule of Cromwell. &nbsp;She fights to make her own path as a woman and earn equal respect as the men around her. &nbsp;She fights for the right to love how and who she wants. These are all things people today struggle with on a daily basis. &nbsp;[Insert joke about choosing not to say &ldquo;quotidian&rdquo;] &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a play that is there to entertain you as any other, but it&rsquo;s also there to push and challenge the way people think. &nbsp;One of the biggest messages is that love is love no matter what. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an important message in 1666 and it&rsquo;s an important message today. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why I do theatre, to affect change and that&rsquo;s what this crazy play is doing.
        <br />
        What have been the biggest challenges for me are the multiple characters I play in the show. &nbsp;Oh? &nbsp;Did I not mention? &nbsp;There&rsquo;s three people in the cast and 7 characters. &nbsp;I play Nell Gwynne, a brilliantly witty but foul-mouthed actress, a cantankerous servant (Maria) and a very wealthy and quite possibly unhinged patron of the arts (Lady Davenport). &nbsp; It&rsquo;s tough giving each character a different posture, age, walk, and voice, but that&rsquo;s what also makes it so fun. &nbsp;One of the highest compliments I get after a show is when an audience member tells me they had no idea that I played all three women. &nbsp;It means I&rsquo;ve done my job well. &nbsp;
        <br />
        Best of all is, you&rsquo;ve still got four weekends to come see it. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve recently been Barrymore Recommended (meaning judges will be coming to the show to nominate the cast and designers for potential awards) which is tremendously exciting. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a truly fantastic show that we&rsquo;ve all worked hard on. &nbsp;Also - if you say I sent you tickets are $10.
        <br />
        Seriously. &nbsp;Come see it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s sexy and witty and wonderful. &nbsp;We run through February 28th! &nbsp;You can reserve tickets at

        Chicago: Onstage to Tech
       </div>
       <p>
        OCT. 20: FIRST RUN
       </p>
       <p>
        The first full run-through of the show was a lot of fun! It feels amazing to be part of an experience where everyone involved is so on top of material they are conquering. It also feels great to know that our rehearsals have gotten to the nit-picky technical stage, so far in advance of tech week; it means the show is in great shape! I actually think this tech week will concentrate less on the movement we do, and more on the technical side of the production. There will be scenes that need to be spaced out and repositioned, but those are expected and easy fixes.
       </p>
       <p>
        We finished staging one of the numbers, &ldquo;All I Care About is Love,&rdquo; just before the first run-through. We have now begun to clean it up and shape it to best fit the group of dynamic actors and dancers. It&rsquo;s fun to experiment with ways in which this part of the show can be as interesting as possible. I&rsquo;m sure that, when audiences see the show, this number will be unforgettable. I am excited to continue cleaning tonight, as I will be at rehearsal from 7:45 to 11 pm. Tonight is a basic brush-up of major numbers, and I&rsquo;m excited to work with choreographer Jeffrey Peterson on some of my favorite parts of the show!
       </p>
       <p>
        OCT. 23: ON STAGE
       </p>
       <p>
        We held our first on-stage rehearsal tonight! That means this was the first time we were rehearsing in the actual space where our show is being held. The Empie Theatre looks fantastic, and when my castmates and I got there, we were in absolute awe of how gorgeous the set looks. I vividly remember the set designer, Tim Averill, explaining his concepts and inspiration for the look of the design on the first day of rehearsal. It was incredible to see these visions being executed so brilliantly!
       </p>
       <p>
        Tech for a show is always a long process. &ldquo;Spacing out&rdquo; the dance numbers on the stage can get daunting. This process, though, is one of my favorite times. The ensemble is very active in the first act of the show, so I did not get much down time during our first day of tech. It was difficult yesterday to keep going from 6:45 to 11, meticulously rehearsing numbers, because of the long day I had yesterday. I am an education major, and on Tuesdays and Thursdays I have early-morning fieldwork, then classes, then rehearsal. It is interesting to move among all these different worlds. I love everything I do, and that is my caffeine for getting through the day. The next week will be difficult, but I know that breathing and taking the time to be appreciative for the opportunities I have will get me through!
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we have a hair tutorial, as I sit here writing this blog with my hair (ridiculously) in pin curls &mdash; more soon!
       </p>
       <p>
        OCT. 24: TECH REHEARSAL
       </p>
       <p>
        The first day of extended tech rehearsal happened this morning and afternoon. It&rsquo;s amazing to see a show that we have been working so hard on for two months starting to come together. We started where we left off yesterday &mdash; right before the ending number. The first rehearsal today was short and sweet, lasting only from 10 to 12:30. Then my castmates and I rushed to the dining hall to stock up before our next chunk of rehearsal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Promptly at 1 we were asked to return to start teching the show &ndash; cue-to-cue. This means that we are primarily focusing on lighting. This can be a tedious part of the tech process, as there is a lot of fast-paced action, followed by stopping for long period of time, then going back to run the section &ldquo;full out&rdquo; (or with all the lighting cues in place). Sometimes it can take hours to do a section that, in real time can only take five minutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the cue-to-cue, we only got through about a half-hour of the show in real-time, but it took us four hours to cue. I do love this process because it shows me all of the aspects that come together in a magical way to make what I have been working on for months come to life. It feels wonderful to get this production lit in beautiful lighting, finally! Tomorrow is a tech rehearsal from 10 am to 11 pm. Though we do have a significant dinner break, I will be exhausted if I do not get some sleep tonight. I have to put down my lesson plans at some point and get some rest!

        In many, many ways, Muhlenberg prepared me excellently for life in the rehearsal hall. The theatre I work for, Hedgerow Theatre (see earlier post for more!) is an SPT, meaning that we have an arrangement with Actor&rsquo;s Equity allowing us to use union actors in some (but not all) of our performances. &nbsp;This means we run by equity rules, much like Muhlenberg. &nbsp;Five&rsquo;s and Ten&rsquo;s are regular. &nbsp;Rehearsal is daily (Mondays off). And yes, 10 of 12 (10 hours of rehearsal in a 12-hour period) exists.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is different from rehearsals at Muhlenberg is that you don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re working with or what you&rsquo;re working on before rehearsals start. &nbsp;When you walk into an audition you may not know the people on the other side of the table and the direction in which they&rsquo;re taking the project &ndash; also true of the first day of rehearsal. &nbsp; &nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        Typically, you get three weeks of rehearsal, one week of tech, previews and opening. &nbsp;At Hedgerow, we have two previews before an opening, whereas other theaters in the area, such as the Arden, have multiple weeks of previews. &nbsp;Rehearsals are also far less regularly scheduled than the mainstage rehearsals at Berg. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s much more like trying to schedule rehearsals in Directing Class and its midterms. &nbsp;Virtually everyone involved with a show has another job, so you may have an erratic rehearsal schedule.
       </p>
       <p>
        All this is to say &ndash; it gets a little less organized once you venture outside of the Bubble. &nbsp;To combat this be AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE. &nbsp;The best approach to any rehearsal is to be ready to go as much as possible whenever possible. &nbsp;That means in your shoes and rehearsal jacket before the start of rehearsal with your lines off book and your body warmed up.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a>
        </a>
        Usually, everyone is on the same page and ready to work, which makes rehearsals as rewarding as possible. &nbsp;In the most recent show I rehearsed,
        <i>
         Dracula
        </i>
        , our director, the inimitable Dan Hodge, was acting in a production that opened the same week as we did, and so we had three hour morning rehearsals the week we opened. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a small amount of time to get a lot of work done. We had to be on our game and ready as soon as it was time so that we were able to fit a run, notes and fixes in before the end of rehearsal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Working with such an amazing, professional and dedicated group of artists, as was the case with
        <i>
         Dracula,
        </i>
        was a real privilege. &nbsp;Amongst our numbers are &rsquo;06 graduate Meghan Winch and &rsquo;14 graduate Josh Portera (also a company member at Hedgerow). &nbsp;We were able to create a fantastic production with a limited rehearsal period due to the tenacity and readiness of everyone involved.

        Fall Dance Gallery- First Showing
       </div>
       <p>
        One showing down,
one to go! This past weekend marked the first showing for
        <i>
         Fall Dance Gallery
        </i>
        and it is crazy to me that we are already at
this point in the rehearsal process. It feels like we began so recently, but already,
both of the pieces I am in for the concert are well underway. I always love to
see what everyone has been working on at the showings and it reminds me how lucky
I am to be able to work alongside such creative minds and bodies, specifically
Cat Chythlook and Emma Bownes, my choreographers this year. While it is fun to
dance in my friends&rsquo; pieces, getting to know someone as a choreographer first
is a very special experience, which is how it is with the pieces I am in this
year. It is very interesting to get to know how someone works creatively and
how this creative process is influenced by the nuances of their personality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Emma&rsquo;s piece is unlike
any dance I have ever been a part of before. One of the very first things she
said to us in rehearsal was &ldquo;This piece is going to be really weird,&rdquo; but she
clarified that, of course, it would be a &ldquo;good weird&rdquo;. She has definitely
delivered on those promises.
       </p>
       <p>
        The piece is about waking up in the morning. There
are ten dancers in the piece, so she was able to create a really cool Rube
Goldberg machine-type chain reaction image; each person&rsquo;s movements cause
another person to &ldquo;wake up.&rdquo; Since there are so many of us, there&rsquo;s always a
lot going on, almost chaotically, so the audience will have a lot to look at.
Another &ldquo;good weird&rdquo; thing about this rehearsal process is that almost every
week, Emma throws bizarre positions or ways of travelling at us. She tells us
that she&rsquo;ll just be goofing around in her room and accidently fall into a
certain position that somehow really works, which causes her to have a light
bulb moment and say &ldquo;I have to put this in my piece!&rdquo; &nbsp;In this way, we incorporated the products of
her playing around in her room. This included, but was not limited to, a crazy
yoga-like
        <a>
        </a>
        position wherein you put your weight on your
hands and face with your legs up in the air, and also a way of moving in a
squatted position while shifting on one hand so that your body, in its balled
up squat position, scoots through the air. Gotta love her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aside from the
zany positions she has us contorting our bodies into, it has been a pleasure so
far to work with Emma and the nine other dancers in the piece, and I can&rsquo;t wait
to see what happens in the coming weeks regarding
        <i>

        rehearsals!

        Adaptation: Accomplished
       </div>
       <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exciting news from my production of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.&rsquo;s
&ldquo;2 B R 0 2 B&rdquo;: after two great weeks of rehearsal,
we finally have a script!
       </p>
       <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That statement
might sound backward for your average piece of theatre, where a script is
probably the starting point. But &ldquo;2 B R 0 2 B&rdquo;
is anything but average. The production, which I am adapting and
directing for this fall&rsquo;s Red Door Play Festival, started with
Vonnegut&rsquo;s short story instead. Then, we added a director (yours
truly), a stage manager, a cast, and people to take care of some of the
trickier set and sound elements. The script, in many ways, came last.
       </p>
       <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instead, we
began rehearsals with a read-through of Vonnegut&rsquo;s short story. The
characters read their dialogue, and the four-person chorus traded off the lines
of narration. Then, we reduced the script to just the character&rsquo;s
lines and began blocking their action&mdash; which I have come to call the &ldquo;core&rdquo;
narrative. As the parts of the cast playing named characters got used to
their own arcs within the story and explored character work, the chorus met
with me to decide exactly how the remaining lines of Vonnegut&rsquo;s
story would be divided. We decided whether text would be best represented out
loud as a line spoken by the chorus or implicitly through something in either
the physicality of the actors or some technical element. This process was long;
it took two full rehearsals to decide what would be said aloud and how it would
be split up, and then I took the selections and assigned them to the various
chorus members.
       </p>
       <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This past
Saturday, we had our first read-through of the script in its full iteration. I
don&rsquo;t want to give too much away quite yet, but I can say that I
was extremely proud of my whole creative team for the work they have been doing
to this point. As we began blocking in the rehearsals since then, I can really
see the show coming together. And most beautiful of all: I can see them owning
it. Everyone in the cast has had a hand in originating their role; they are, quite literally,
the owners of this material, and I look forward to seeing them share their
passionate, interested work with audiences in three (ahh! just three!) short
weeks.

        Hedgerow - Allison
       </div>
       <p>
        Hey &lsquo;Berg!
       </p>
       <p>
        For those of you whom I have not met, I&rsquo;m Allison Bloechl, a graduate of the class of 2014. &nbsp;For those of my friends who read that and had a heart attack, don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m still Allie. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s what I am up to out in the &ldquo;real world.&rdquo;
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, I am a full-time company member and acting fellow at Hedgerow Theatre, America&rsquo;s oldest repertory theatre. &nbsp;Hedgerow is located just outside of Philly, about an hour from Muhlenberg. Our legacies include Shaw, Brecht, Ibsen and, yes, even Keanu. &nbsp;Hedgerow is a company-based theatre that produces professional theatre all year long.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do a lot at Hedgerow. &nbsp;Technically, I am the female Acting Fellow with the company, but really it is so much more than that. &nbsp;Hedgerow prides itself on being company-based. &nbsp;Everyone does everything. &nbsp;Besides being the resident leading lady, I am the Box Office Manager and Fight Choreographer, and I offer support in other departments, such as production, props, and marketing. &nbsp;Josh Portera (&rsquo;14), one of our three male Acting Fellows, additionally works in marketing and dramaturgy on top of his work as a performer. We wear many hats here.
       </p>
       <p>
        I&rsquo;ve been with Hedgerow a little over a year now and since then have had the opportunity of performing in four of their mainstages:
        <i>
         A Murder has been Arranged
        </i>
        (Lady Beatrice),
        <i>
         Don Quixote&nbsp;
        </i>
        (Maritornes, Curate, others),
        <i>
         No Sex Please, We&rsquo;re British
        </i>
        (Susan), and most recently
        <i>
         Bullshot Crummond,
        </i>
        in which I not only performed as the evil Lenya Von Brunno but was the show&rsquo;s fight choreographer. &nbsp;This Saturday (10/24) we open a five week run of
        <i>
         Dracula
        </i>
        in which I am playing Lucy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coming up we have our yearly production of
        <i>
         A Christmas Carol
        </i>
        , followed by
        <i>
         The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy
        </i>
        in January, where I will be playing Trillian. &nbsp;February brings the regional debut of Liz Duffy Adams&rsquo;
        <i>
         Or,
        </i>
        a three-person show about the life of Aphra Behn, playwright, mistress, and spy. &nbsp;Among several characters, I will be playing Behn&rsquo;s favorite actress and lover, Nell Gwynne. &nbsp;In March we have the world premiere of Agatha Christie&rsquo;s
        <i>
         The Mysterious Affair at Styles
        </i>
        followed by a new adaptation of
        <i>
         The Servant of Two Masters
        </i>
        &mdash; both of which I will be performing in as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        So all in all the real world has been
        <a>
        </a>
        pretty fantastic. &nbsp;Keep cultivating relationships and learning as much as you can, Muhlenstudents!
       </p>

        Finally, Fosse! - Erica
       </div>
       <p>
        We have been in rehearsals for Chicago for quite some time now, and tonight is the night of our first full run-through! It is so exciting to get this show on its feet, finally, after all of the extraordinary work put in by our talented cast members in rehearsal! This process is very different than my show experience last year. During last year&rsquo;s production of Anyone Can Whistle, I was a recent transfer student. I remember not knowing many people, but through the process, getting to know so many wonderful people. This year, I was so ready to have a great experience, yet again, upon being cast in Chicago! The most excitement for me was centered on getting the opportunity to become more experienced with Fosse-style dancing. I have taken classes in the past, but there are not many opportunities to actually work on a show in this style. I was very excited about working with the team of directors: Charlie Richter, Michael Schnack, and Jeffrey Peterson. Though I have worked with Charlie and Michael previously, in Street Scene (where I was also a blogger!) and over the summer in Hello, Dolly!, I was particularly ready to jump into a new style of theater with the team. I was so excited to work with Jeffrey for the first time. &nbsp;I guarantee that audiences will be in awe of his intricate choreography, incorporating Fosse-style dancing with some of his own style! &nbsp;It is fun to work with such an experimental choreographer; Jeffrey has a unique ability to look at his pool of dancers and mold, craft and fit the dancing to best suit his cast. I believe that the dancing will be one of the most memorable aspects of Chicago. I can&rsquo;t wait to share how our first full run goes!&nbsp;

        At Last, Atlas - Mary Rollins

       It would be a huge understatement
to say that the Muhlenberg Circus Workshop&rsquo;s
       <i>
        Atlas

       was a success. This weekend was finally show time and it was

       sold out all three shows: Friday night, Saturday afternoon, and Saturday night.
All three performances even had wait-lists of students who wanted to see the
show, some for a second time around. Loosely based on the story of
       <i>
        Alice in Wonderland
       </i>
       with acrobatics,
aerial stunts, Cyr wheel, juggling, dancing, and comedy,
       <i>
        Atlas
       </i>
       became the talk of the town.
       <br />
       <br />
       I have never been so proud of the
final results of a show. Each individual act was extremely entertaining and
awe-inspiring given the impossible feats the cast performed. But it wasn&rsquo;t just
the raw talent that made this show what it was. Everything from the intricately
planned out stage design to the literal hundreds of light cues brought this
show to a new level &mdash; not to mention the unparalleled atmosphere of this cast
that has worked tirelessly throughout the year to the point where we have
become a family.
       <br />
       <br />
       To think that only five months ago
we had no idea if we would get to perform on a stage. Now we have finished a
spectacularly successful weekend. I have never felt such a rush of pride as the
moment when the curtain rose for bows on opening night and the audience was
already on their feet cheering. &nbsp;It was
only after the curtain went down after our final show that it truly hit me that
this beautiful creation I was a part of had brought people to tears (audience
and cast members alike). Though Circus is finished for this school year I
cannot wait to see what bigger and better things will take place in years to
come

        The Circus isn&rsquo;t Coming to Town, It&rsquo;s Here. - Mary Rollins
       </div>
       <p>
        Muhlenberg Circus Workshop&rsquo;s
production of
        <i>
         Atlas
        </i>
        is nearly here!
One week from now a school years&rsquo; worth of work will have been shown to a hopefully
large and appreciative audience. In the meantime we are hard at work,
finalizing the show before we begin tech rehearsals in the Baker Theatre. One
of the most exciting developments related to Circus recently is the growing campus
awareness and excitement for the upcoming show. People from across all fields
of academic and extra-curricular areas have been talking about &ldquo;the circus
coming to town.&rdquo;
       </p>
       <p>
        This is
in part due to the Circus&rsquo;s publicity around the school and surrounding area in
recent weeks. In March we went to Jefferson Elementary School to spend an
afternoon performing for and hanging out with the adorable kids there. Weeks
later we were lucky enough to have an event with Muhlenberg&rsquo;s Best Buddy
Program where we performed and had carnival games (see attached picture of the
cast post-pie-in-the-face).&nbsp; Most recently
we teamed up with a few film students here on campus to create several
promotional videos for
        <i>
         Atlas,
        </i>
        one of which you can view here:

       </p>
       <p>
        Circus
has also recently gained a liaison to the Muhlenberg Dance Association. I had
the honor of being selected last week to hold this new position. Hopefully this
means that, after its first year in one of the college&rsquo;s larger theatres,
Circus can continue to have a prominent standing and become an even more
integral part of the Theatre and Dance Department.

        Spitzprobe! - Erica
       </div>
       <p>
        Tonight (3/19) the children were called to go over the &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Game&rdquo; to start off the exciting sitzprobe! This is the German term for a seated rehearsal in which the cast sings with the orchestra for the first time. The orchestra sounds absolutely amazing! Even the warm-up exercises that the orchestra played while the cast was settling into their seats was exciting. I believe the cast knows this show backwards and forwards by now, because we have been doing run-throughs for SO long. An exciting sitzprobe was exactly what our cast needed to jump-start tech week. The music sounded fresh, exciting, and new again. Street Scene&rsquo;s score is so beautiful, and I can&rsquo;t wait to share it with an audience! &nbsp;I was surprised that I have never heard any of this gorgeous music before.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sitzprobe began with all of the children&rsquo;s music, which at times can get tricky because we often sing from off-stage, so the musical director, Michael Schnack, cannot always conduct us. That&rsquo;s where our fabulous child wrangler, Annie, goes into action. She will be conducting the children off-stage. After going over these tricky spots, the ensemble came onstage to start working out the first of many group numbers. With the addition of the orchestra, the stakes were raised and the cast got a fresh perspective on the music that encompassed so much more emotional depth than we&rsquo;ve been accustomed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, I had a final costume fitting today! My costume was changed from an adorable outfit I had tried on at my last fitting; however, I enjoy the new one even more! I cannot wait to wear it in the show. Street Scene begins tech rehearsals tonight, and I am so excited to get the ball rolling toward next week&rsquo;s opening!
       </p>
       <p>
        While I was sitting with the children during the sitzprobe, one of them did happen to provide me with a little chuckle in the middle of such a heightened rehearsal. She said to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tiny! How am I supposed to sing louder in this big place?!&rdquo; To which I quoted in my head the famous line from Gypsy: &ldquo;Sing out, Louise!&rdquo;

        Splish, Splash, Circus - Mary Rollins
       </div>
       <p>
        What could possibly be more fun than an ordinary circus rehearsal? Circus rehearsal in the pool! That&rsquo;s right. I could barely believe it too when our director Noah Dach &lsquo;16, told us our final full cast rehearsal before spring break would involve a trip to Muhlenberg&rsquo;s indoor pool. During a week of mid-terms and other pre-break stressers a night at the pool practicing flips, partnering, and acrobatics was just what we all needed. It was a great place to practice new tricks, such as transitioning from standing on someone&rsquo;s shoulders to standing on their hands. This is normally very difficult, but with the weightlessness in the water anything seems possible.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Now that we are back from spring break it is time to take what we&rsquo;ve been working on all semester (as well as some of our new skills from our pool visit), and get down to business preparing for our show in April! This means we are back to rehearsing six nights a week in order to have the show completely finished by our second showing in just two weeks. Our first showing in February went very well. All the faculty that viewed our presentation felt we were on the right track, which was a huge compliment to us all. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean all the hard work is over. Noah told us in our first rehearsal after the break that these next three weeks would be &ldquo;the most important of them all.&ldquo; No pressure right? Luckily this talented cast can handle whatever is thrown at them. This is the time when the scenes of acrobatics, dancing, aerial silks, juggling, and clowning all come together to make a cohesive story.

        Designer Run - Erica
       </div>
       <p>
        Tonight&rsquo;s run was interesting to say the very least! Annie (our fabulous child wrangler) was not present for rehearsal and I had to act as pseudo-wrangler. &ldquo;Being&rdquo; a child and &ldquo;wrangling&rdquo; the children are TWO SERPARATE JOBS. Let that statement be known. I didn&rsquo;t have to do the dirty work of actually conducting the children, as Annie does, but I did have to make sure they were well-behaved and knew when to go on and off of the stage. It was convenient for me, because those are my entrances and exits as well. As expected, I did have an easy time working as the child&rsquo;s superior (despite most of them being my height), although some of them did not take me totally seriously because, after all, we are all &ldquo;children&rdquo; in Street Scene. However, it was fun to get to take on another fun job at rehearsal for a day!
       </p>
       <p>
        The run as a whole went very successfully! It feels great showing off our production to the professionals who have been working on the show behind the scenes. All aspects of the production seem to be going according to plan, and making incredible progress as my cast mates and I become more and more familiar with the work. It is also a privilege to get to see the professional vocal teachers (at Muhlenberg) Lauren and Ed perform each day. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, Lauren Curnow and Ed Bara, faculty members, are playing two of the lead roles in the production. Working with them, and simply observing them as they work has been inspiring and highly educational.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        As usual, I will end my blog post with a favorite quote stated by a child cast member. &ldquo;I will ALWAYS be thought of as the cutest one in a group because&hellip; well&hellip; JUST LOOK AT ME! I&rsquo;M SHORT!&rdquo; &hellip; Afterwards I just nodded and agreed, &ldquo;Me too&hellip;. Me too&rdquo;.

        Dance Emerge Begins! - Loren
       </div>
       <p>
        Wow! What a whirlwind semester this has been so far, and
we&rsquo;re only five weeks in! Ok, so let me tell you what&rsquo;s been going on so far in
the Dance Department. The first week of every semester consists of auditions,
so in the fall, there are auditions for
        <i>
         Master
Choreographers, Moving Stories, and Fall Gallery
        </i>
        , and in the spring there
are auditions for
        <i>
         Dance Emerge
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         Spring Gallery
        </i>
        . Also at the start of the
spring semester, rehearsals for
        <i>
         Master
Choreographers
        </i>
        pick right back up because that concert performs during the first
weekend of February! I was lucky enough to be cast in a Masters piece this year,
and those performances were definitely one of the highlights of my year. My
choreographer was Jeffrey Peterson, a faculty member here at Muhlenberg. The
piece was based upon the notion of fight or flight, so the movement was very
weighted and grounded. There are some pictures on the Theatre and Dance website
(
        <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F18Oetru&amp;t=ZWIyZGMxY2YwODYwZTc4MTdiYWQ4NDY5ZTk1ZTcwOGZiYWQ4MGMyNCxhazVQcWJIRA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ALq3WNlBnejLbuPHncgjosA&amp;m=1" target="_blank">
         bit.ly/18Oetru
        </a>
        ) that you can check out!
       </p>
       <p>
        But back to that first week. In order to choreograph for
        <i>
         Moving Stories
        </i>
        or
        <i>
         Dance Emerge
        </i>
        , each student has to propose choreography, an idea,
and music in front of a group of faculty, and then they choose who will get to
choreograph throughout the semester. I have previously choreographed for two
Gallery Concerts, the first last spring, and the second last fall. Because of
my past choreographic experience, the fact that I am enrolled in Dance
Composition class, as well as having been an understudy in this past year&rsquo;s
        <i>
         Moving Stories
        </i>
        concert, I was eligible to
propose for
        <i>
         Dance Emerge
        </i>
        .&nbsp; So, I decided to give it a shot. I felt it was a
good decision, because even if I didn&rsquo;t get chosen, at least the faculty would
know that I was serious, and then hopefully consider me for future concerts.
Well, the proposal meeting was on Monday and the email came out on Thursday with
my name on the list!! This was beyond exciting because
now I would get costumes and lighting designed by the department production
team, which are not provided for the Gallery concerts. Tomorrow we already have
our first
        <i>
         Dance Emerge
        </i>
        showing in
front of the artistic director, Jeffrey, as well as the lighting and costume
crew. I&rsquo;ll be back with an update after the showing!

        Another View of Master Choreographers - Mary Rollins
       </div>
       <p>
        And now it&rsquo;s all over. After months of rehearsal, a week of tech, and four shows in three days Master Choreographers is finished until next year. And though it is sad to see it be over, it was an incredible experience I am so happy to have been a part of. The weekend worth of shows displayed a truly incredible amount of talent from all of the performers, choreographers, and tech crew involved in the show.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        As a freshman, this was my first introduction to Master Choreographers and let&rsquo;s just say I was immensely impressed with my fellow cast members and the caliber of performance. Even the other dancers in Heidi Cruz-Austin&rsquo;s piece Summer Concerto with whom I have been rehearsing for months demonstrated unparalleled passion and a performance quality during all of the shows.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        You might think that a weekend spent in a theater would be potentially a dull way to spend a weekend, but between warm-up, backstage jokes, and actually performing, my Master&rsquo;s weekend was as lively as could be. &nbsp;A few highlights of the show include the array of warm-ups given before each performance by one of the Dance faculty members. Particularly Karen Dearborn&rsquo;s warmup before our closing show during which she led tendus and plies to current hits such as &ldquo;Uptown Funky Walk&rdquo;. Also a favorite aspect of the performances includes the time in which the entire cast stands in a circle on the stage holding hands and &ldquo;passes the squeeze&rdquo; down the line. It brings a level of connectedness and focus to the group that I see as a vital part of any performance.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the pre-show events, the performances themselves were exciting to be a part of because how often do we get to dance in front of a live, sold-out audience? By opening night everyone felt comfortable on the stage and ready to perform. The show was a major success with a large audience and dancers ending every piece with a bow and a proud grin. The Friday night show and two Saturday show audiences were packed and eager to applaud. I feel as if with each show the performance grew stronger and stronger, something I didn&rsquo;t think possible after watching many of the pieces backstage during Thursday night&rsquo;s show.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Our final performance was bitter-sweet. By this time Saturday we had already had a performance that afternoon and were beginning to feel slightly drained, not to mention it would be the last Master&rsquo;s performance for the wonderful group of seniors involved in the show. But in the end we were all so proud of what we had accomplished. We had been given the chance to share what we most love with our school community and outside guests who came to see our hard work pay off.

        The Fight Call - Erica
       </div>
       <p>
        The rehearsal this past Friday included a fight call among the children. The scene we were working on occurs at the start of Act II, and, at some point or another, involves all of the &ldquo;children&rdquo; to fight with each other. My motherly instincts naturally came out, as I was challenged to pretend fight with some of these kids&hellip;. All the while asking them if they are &ldquo;being careful&rdquo; and &ldquo;not hitting their heads&rdquo;. The wonderful fight choreographer that was called in to stage these battles is a professor of fight mastery on campus.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am actually very interested in the art of stage combat. Over the summer I worked on a production of Oklahoma! which utilized a large amount of combat choreography. The only thing that was different was that the actors in Oklahoma! were young adults- now I am dealing with second graders trying to understand these complex movements and execute them without hurting themselves! Although the mommy-in-me seemed to be on the brink of BURSTING throughout the rehearsal, the child actors really pulled it together and the whole scene is looking flawless.
       </p>
       <p>
        I did have an interesting moment with one of the children this week. She and I were discussing ages and grades in school, as one does when in second grade. She was a particularly outgoing and bright kid so I decided to ask her some questions, one of them being, &ldquo;so how old do you think I am?!&rdquo; She responded by saying, &ldquo;well I am trying to think of the &lsquo;college ages&rsquo;, because you are in college. Let me see&hellip;.&rdquo; And after much internal debate she came up with 19. Surprisingly close, because I&rsquo;m 20! Then the little girl went on to describe how she came up with the almost perfect answer.&nbsp; Later she gave a bit of advice to all the college kids which was, &ldquo;conduct experiments to see which friends have the flu. If your friend has it&hellip;. STOP BEING THEIR FRIEND BECAUSE YOUR GONNA GET THE FLU.&rdquo; So obviously the muhlen-plague is a thing in her school to :)

        It&#039;s Showtime - Emma F. (2/6)
       </div>
       <p>
        And the show has begun! I cannot believe we have already had two performances; the weekend is just flying by! I thought the dressing room was crazy during tech and final dress rehearsal but it was even crazier on opening night! Everyone was running around trying to put their costumes on, making sure their make up was perfect, and having a fellow performer do their hair. The excitement and energy was everywhere backstage and the nervous jitters were spreading too. My fellow cast members and I went on to the stage to prepare for our piece to start. We all were jumping around and whispering with excitement because we could hear the audience members settling into their seats.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Opening night is always so exciting because it is the first performance of the weekend and you finally get to see how people react to the pieces. When the introductions were finished, the house lights went down and the audience became silent. The curtain then opened and we were ready to dance. When the stage lights came on I got even more excited than before, and my nerves disappeared because I was ready to perform. Dorrell&rsquo;s piece went so well because we were all so full of energy, and excited to perform for an audience.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Every time a piece would finish the dancers would come back to the dressing rooms smiling and practically giddy, because everything was going so well and the audience seemed to love the performance. I enjoyed hearing all of my fellow dancers talking about how the pieces went. I think it&rsquo;s so interesting to hear some people say they messed up a count or a hand gesture because we all get so worried that it would mess up the whole piece when really no one really notices besides us. Also, many people in the same pieces think their performance went perfectly while others think it went horribly. But in the end, what the audience really notices is a group of amazing dancers moving together on stage.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Today the soreness is starting to set in but we are all overpowering it so that we can make the last two shows of the 2015 Master Choreographers run as effective as the first two. It&rsquo;s sad to think that we have already done two performances and only have two more to go. Tomorrow is going to be crazy with back to back, sold out shows, but I know that they will be as energized and fun as the first two!

        Long Time, No See! - Erica
       </div>
       <p>
        The time has come for the first run through of Act I! I have
been a bit MIA from rehearsals, as I was involved in a production of The Music
Man- Concert, an event to benefit &nbsp;the New
Jersey Youth Theater; This was the company I studied musical theater, acting,
voice and dance with since I was young. Because I have been traveling back and
forth from New Jersey I had missed out on many fun rehearsals with my little
friends! Luckily, I am back to stay, at &lsquo;berg and couldn&rsquo;t be more excited. The
first rehearsal I had with my fellow children proved interesting. The kids have
SO much exciting energy that they radiate throughout the rehearsal room.
Dancing with them was not only fun for me, but I great learning experience. At
Muhlenberg, I am a theater major, with a goal to obtain my PreK-4 Education
Certification. Being on this track makes my days quite long! Although times can
get stressful trying to accomplish all that I plan for myself to do, I find
that enjoying every bit of what I&rsquo;m involved in makes all of my tasks valuable
to me. Being a child ensemble member in Street Scene, I not only find myself
loving every minute of portraying a little kid, but I love working with the
children, because, after all, I do hope to work with these ages for the rest of
my life while not pursuing theater!
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the big run-through, the children were called in to
rehearse our big moment in the show. It appears at the top of Act II, and is
called, &ldquo;Catch Me If You Can- Children&rsquo;s Game&rdquo;. Dancing with the children also
serves as a valuable teaching opportunity, which I am honored to help out with.
I not only love performing with the kids, but love helping them out when they
have questions or are struggling with tricky dance moves.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have decided that going forward with my entries, I will
conclude with a little tidbit that was said to me by my one fellow little
ones&hellip;many of them say the most entertaining things, so it seems best to include
these WISE words. Tonight&rsquo;s quote, said in response to me getting into my
dancing spot, which happened to form a triangle with my fellow dancers, &ldquo;Erica&hellip;
you HAVE to get into the triangle!&hellip; You know, like the Bermuda Triangle!!!&rdquo;&hellip;
It&rsquo;s great to know that history lessons make an appearance in theatrical dance
from time to time in the eyes of a second grader!

        Tech Week for Masters - Emma F.
       </div>
       <p>
        Tech week has flown by, like it always does when a show weekend comes around. The first night of tech was rough with music problems in the first piece and a whole lighting change for one of the pieces and what usually only takes two or three hours turned into a four-hour tech run. To add to the usual hectic first day of tech, several dancers had issues with costumes, but luckily the costume crew was there to fix everything. Despite the problems during day one, day two went smoothly. All the dancers were nervous about day one repeating itself but it went much more smoothly than originally expected.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        During the first day of tech there was a slight music problem during Dorrell&rsquo;s piece. I was standing on stage along with a few of the other cast members, and we were worried that the problem wasn&rsquo;t going to be fixed. After three tries the music finally worked and we were able to run the piece. That run was not the best we&rsquo;ve ever danced the piece but we did not let the slight malfunction get into our heads while running the piece. Last night was the full dress rehearsal. In the dressing rooms all the dancers were making sure they had the right make up and hair because they wanted to look good for pictures. Not only was the photographer there but also a few audience members so we all knew that the run had to be treated like an actual show. &nbsp;The curtain opened and my fellow cast members and I ran our piece and it ended up being one of the best times we have ever ran the piece. We all had the energy that we would have during an actual show, which I think definitely made the piece so lively and gave it the spark it needed. During the full dress rehearsal I was able to watch the rest of the show and it looks amazing. I am so excited for the show to start tonight because this year&rsquo;s production of Master Choreographers is going to be a great one!

        The Audition Process - Erica
       </div>
       <p>
        When I attended an information session concerning Street
Scene and casting, I knew I had to try and be part of this process. As an
actress, I am drawn to any material that seems different and exciting. If cast
in Street Scene, I was sure that the experiences I would have would teach me
things I could carry with me in my later career. The process of auditioning
involved picking from an assortment of music that the characters sing. Based on
our selective choices, we would be then called back for other, more specific
roles that the piece entailed. I had so much fun at the audition, and soon
found out I was called back to dance for a child role. Because of my petite
stature, I was not at all surprised by this news.
       </p>
       <p>
        The callback for the &ldquo;children&rdquo; involved a few Muhlenberg College students, and
various children that lived in Allentown or neighboring locations. Upon meeting
the real children who were auditioning, I certainly got a bit nostalgic. I
started to think back to when I was their age, just starting to get out and
audition for productions, and how nervous I was. Actually, many of the children
claimed this as their first audition ever! I remember my first audition
experience, and these children certainly handled it better than I did. I was
auditioning for &ldquo;42
        <sup>
         nd
        </sup>
        Street&rdquo; as a dancer. It was a mostly high school
and college &ndash;aged production at the community scale. I was so nervous I started
crying! Because of my (interesting?) first audition experience, I knew it was
my job to make these youngins&rsquo; feel as comfortable as possible. After all, I
did want to be cast alongside of them! Later, I found out that I was indeed cast as a
&lsquo;child&rsquo; and ensemble member in Street Scene, and when I found out the great news,
I could not have been more excited to start the process!

        Master Choreographers&#039; Tech Begins - Emma F.
       </div>
       <p>
        It&rsquo;s crazy to think that it is already tech week! It seems like just yesterday that I was in my first seven-hour rehearsal for Dorrell Martin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Master Choreographers&rsquo; piece. Dorrell is a guest choreographer who has come to Muhlenberg annually for the last several years to choreograph various works for us.&nbsp;
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Since Dorrell travels from far to work with us, last semester we only had one weekend of long rehearsals so he could set the piece and a few two-hour rehearsals here and there until this week. While we were rehearsing, the whole cast of the piece, myself included, was kind of worried about what was going to happen to the piece when we got on stage because we didn&rsquo;t have weekly rehearsals but after having ran the piece on the stage, in costume, we are all feeling a lot more confident about it now. Also, the dance itself is so intricate that we were worried about messing up the counts or hitting the wrong accent in the movement and music.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        I think the piece really came full circle when we had cue-to-cue this past Saturday. When we stepped on stage in our costumes and with all the dramatic lighting I couldn&rsquo;t believe how far the dance and the whole cast had come. In Dorrell&rsquo;s piece we are supposed to be representing water and that feeling really came to life for me when I stepped onto the stage. Our costumes are blue and teal and naturally move and flow when we dance which reminds me so much of the way waves move in the ocean. The lighting gives the piece a watery atmosphere as well, with so many different shades of blue hitting the stage along with subtle movements of the lights. It will be so interesting to see the final outcome of the lighting and the little fixes to the costumes because everything already looks amazing that the dance will probably just turn out so much better than I already think it is.
        <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        I am excited to be able to watch the other dances in the show this week because each one is so unique that I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine what the final products will look like. So many of us dancers have been talking about our costumes and just our pieces in general that we all can not wait to see what they actually turn out to be like. The chaos will be in full swing at the first dress rehearsal and it will definitely continue all week and it probably won&rsquo;t end until the show is completely over! I know I am going to be getting more and more nervous and excited with each rehearsal. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what this week has in store for my for my first Master Choreographers performances!

        Back in the US! - Jillian
       </div>
       <p>
        Now that I&rsquo;m home in the United States, I&rsquo;d like to talk about some smaller experiences I had at the Accademia dell'Arte that are definitely worth knowing about the program!
       </p>
       <p>
        In October, we had a week long mask-making intensive workshop, where each student got to make their own commedia dell&rsquo;arte stock character mask. A professional mask maker, Andrea, came and walked us through the process with his assistant, Alessandra. He showed us what to do, but also let it be a very independent process. The masks are made out of leather, and it took us about twenty hours of class to make one! Talking to Andrea was great because it gave us another perspective on the Commedia characters, and he had lots of stories that went with each kind of mask.
       </p>
       <p>
        A huge pro of the program was participating in cabarets. There are three cabarets each semester at ADA, and each one has a different theme. The environment of the cabarets was very accepting and I loved showing up and helping out, even if I did not come with any of my own material. This process took something that seemed very intimidating at first and made it so accessible. In addition to the three cabarets, there were also three open mic nights, where any student could bring in any form of art that they wished.
       </p>
       <p>
        A lot of people at Muhlenberg hear that there will be hardly any time for recreational travel if you attend this program. While it is true that there are always classes into the afternoon and evening Monday through Friday, weekend trips and day trips are completely possible! There was only one weekend where I stayed in Arezzo the whole time. Other than the school organized trips to Florence, Milan, and Assisi, I also travelled by myself or in small groups. In the Tuscany and Umbria regions, I went to Siena, Cortona, Orvieto, and Perugia, which are all smaller towns on hills overlooking the beautiful countryside. As far as major Italian cities go, I went to Rome, Pisa, and Venice, which were full of historical culture. Early on in the semester, myself and seven other Muhlenberg students ventured to Cinque Terre, which was by far my favorite place in Italy, where we went cliff-jumping on the scenic western coast of the country. We even took a short weekend trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, which was a nice change from the Italian culture we had been used to. We also had a ten day fall break, in which I travelled to Barcelona and Madrid in Spain and Brussels and Bruges in Belgium. All of these travel experiences helped shape my abroad experience, and the program never discouraged me and other students from travelling in our free time on the weekends. Finally, when the semester ended, I headed to London to visit all of the Muhlenberg theatre students studying abroad at Queen Mary University and Goldsmith University!
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, this semester was the best experience of my life, and I am so thankful for everything I learned during my classes and travels. If anyone has any questions about the program, feel free to email me at

        The Week is Here! - Samantha 12/2
       </div>
       <p>
        Here it is! The semester is coming to an end and the busiest weeks are beginning. For me, the first week of December is going to be one of the craziest weeks of my life. The Sunday I got back from Thanksgiving break I had a three-hour rehearsal for Candlelight Carols, and since then my schedule has been nonstop. It is tech and performance week for both Candlelight Carols and The fall Dance Gallery &mdash; oh, and did I mention I have to write, edit and turn in a million final papers, all while studying for finals! If that is not crazy, then I don&rsquo;t know what is.
       </p>
       <p>
        My first semester has been crazy, and yet amazing at the same time. I have met so many new people and have learned so much, which is why I&rsquo;m not too nervous about these next few weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        Candlelight Carols is going to be such a cool experience. For those who don&rsquo;t know, Candlelight Carols is a church service held every year at Muhlenberg during the holidays. But it is no ordinary service. Throughout the service there will be live music, and accompanying the music will be dancers! The advanced composition class was split up into pairs, and each pair had to choreograph a dance. The pieces that I am in have been coming together well! From what I have been told, it is a beautiful service and a very popular event for all, and I am so grateful to be a part of it.
       </p>
       <p>
        On top of that, here comes the week of truth, the week of fall Dance Gallery performances! I am so beyond excited not only to perform Caitlin Fell&rsquo;s and Megan Lawrence&rsquo;s pieces, but also to be performing my lab piece that was choreographed in my Dance Technique and Performance class by Megan Flynn, our professor. Both Caitlin and Megan (Lawrence) are some of the sweetest girls that I have ever met. I truly understand what they meant when upperclassmen told me at the beginning of the semester that student-choreographed pieces can be the most rewarding. I feel so grateful to have been given the opportunity to work with such talented and hardworking students.&nbsp; I will truly have a void in my week without having the six extra rehearsal hours with all of these people to whom I have become so close. I will also really miss my Dance Technique and Performance Class. I am so happy that my classmates and I have been able to create a lab piece together, on top of everything else that we have been working on. After all, we have been together every morning from 9:30 to 10:50 for the past 15 weeks. When else will you get that kind of experience? I love every single person in my Dance Technique and Performance class, and together we have grown as dancers and as students. So, here&rsquo;s to a crazy week!

        Firenze, Milano, e Assisi! - Jillian
       </div>
       <p>
        Ciao again!
       </p>
       <p>
        Another big part of my semester has been the trips that are included in the tuition here at the Accademia dell&rsquo;Arte. We have been on three organized trips, and I learned a lot from each one while seeing some overwhelmingly beautiful sights.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second weekend of the semester, the theatre students went on a day trip to Florence. Florence is the closest large city to Arezzo, and it only takes an hour to get there by train. Monica (the director of student services at the Accademia) took us on a walking tour of Florence, and she explained the history behind some of the most famous monuments, including the cathedral, Pitti Palace, and the Uffizi museums as well as the Medici family. After our tour, we had a whole day to explore on our own. Five other theatre students and I got pizza and went to the Giardino di Boboli (Boboli Gardens), which is what the royal gardens of Versailles in France are based off of. We explored the never ending green maze for hours, making this my favorite site in Florence.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the end of September, the theatre students went on a three day trip to Milan, which is about three hours north by train. We were especially excited for this trip because we got to see our Commedia dell&rsquo;Arte teacher, Michele, play the leading role in the premiere of
        <em>
         La Storia di Qu
        </em>
        , by famous Italian playwright and political activist, Dario Fo. Fo attended the performance and gave a speech, which was very exciting to witness, and we loved the show even though we did not fully understand the language, as it was in Italian. (Luckily, it was a very physical show, so we could follow a lot of the plot through body language.) Also on this trip, we got a private tour of the Piccolo Teatro, a famous theatre in Milan, and were even lucky enough to tour the workshops for the Teatro la Scala. The workshops were huge and extremely impressive.&nbsp; We even got a sneak peak of the sets for their next opera in addition to seeing their costume shop, which houses thousands of costumes! (Some productions have over 100 costumes each!) After that, we were in for another surprise; Monica managed to get us free tickets to the dress rehearsal of a music concert at the Teatro la Scala. It was wonderful to get to experience so much Italian art and theatre in one weekend. But we also had plenty of free time while there, so we saw the grand cathedral and explored the eleven museums that make up the Sforza Castle. And of course we made time to do some shopping &ndash; it is the fashion capital of the world, after all!
       </p>
       <p>
        Our final trip was the following week, when all of the theatre and music students went on a day trip to Assisi together. It was a very special time to be there, because it was the eve of the feast day of St. Francis, the patron saint of Assisi. A professor from Furman University took us on a tour of all of the churches and cathedrals in the town, and we had some time to wander around as well. Assisi was truly magical &ndash; each street and piazza was more beautiful than the last, and spending time there on such a significant day of celebration added an electric energy to the already charming small town. This trip also contrasted nicely to the last two organized trips, which took us to much larger metropolitan cities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stay tuned for more information about my travel adventures in Italy!

        Fall Dance Gallery Final Showing - Loren
       </div>
       <p>
        Last week we had our second and final showing for the Fall Dance Gallery. A showing is when all of the choreographers and faculty advisors come together for an informal viewing of each other&rsquo;s pieces. Our first showing was about a month ago, and I was very happy with the feedback I received. For this showing, we had to have the piece finished, and without really planning it, my piece bordered on six minutes long! I was very happy with that, because last semester, I think my piece was around four minutes and thirty seconds.
       </p>
       <p>
        We were also required to have our dancers in costume for this showing, and that required a whole new set of preparations. For this piece, I never envisioned my dancers in strictly pedestrian clothing, yet the piece does not need elaborate recital type costumes. That would&rsquo;ve drastically changed the mood in a way that I did not want. So I took a trip up to the costume shop, which was definitely a little bit overwhelming, because the people who work in the costume shop never get a break. Last weekend was
        <em>
         Moving Stories
        </em>
        , the Dance Program&rsquo;s first Mainstage of the year, so the costume shop was in the midst of last minute repairs and fixes.
        <em>
         Agamemnon
        </em>
        , the Theatre Program&rsquo;s classical Mainstage opens tonight, so the shop was also hard at work creating those costumes. So I grabbed the dance storage binder and stole myself a little spot in the corner of the room. I flipped through the pages and found some things I liked, and was lucky enough for one of the work-study students to be able to take me down to the storage. Unfortunately, not everything that was in the binder was in the actual bins, so I signed out a few things and then collaborated with my dancers to make up the difference. Later, at the showing, my costumes were approved! So that is definitely a relief. However, my idea for the title did not fare as well, so I will have to do some brainstorming about that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, however, the second showing went well. Generally, my feedback was to prolong the moments of tension I have already created, and to fix some transitions. Teresa, one of the dance faculty members, said that there is a very fine line between choppy movement and bad transitions, so I have to take a closer look at that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot believe that this is our last full week of rehearsals! I looked at my planner the other day and freaked out a little bit! Next week is Thanksgiving break, so we will miss our Wednesday rehearsal, and most probably our Sunday rehearsal as well, and then tech starts on Monday! Because of that, I scheduled an extra rehearsal this week to make up for the lost time. I cannot believe the show is basically here! It snuck up so fast! I am very excited, but there is still so much to be done.

        The moments that define us and the heart in all of us - Samantha
       </div>
       <p>
        The direction that I am going with for my blog is about surviving &hellip; well, actually thriving as a first-semester freshman dance major.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        This may sound like a clich&eacute;, but time really does fly when you are having fun&hellip; and by &ldquo;fun,&rdquo; I mean stressing about tests, dancing five-plus days a week, and trying to get enough sleep, while also fitting in time for homework and hanging out with new friends. Yes, first semester as a college freshman may sound a bit stressful &mdash; but I cannot believe that it is coming to an end so soon!&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I completed my final midterm exam, and now I am already trying to figure out what classes to take next semester! As for the Fall Dance Gallery, we had our first showing a few weeks ago. I loved seeing all of the other pieces that people have been working on, as well as being able to perform the two pieces that I am in. At first I was a little bit nervous about performing two pieces that I feel so dearly about and that my fellow dancers have put their hearts and souls into. I mean, I did
        <em>
         not
        </em>
        want to mess up. However, I was reassured by both Megan and Caitlin, my choreographers, that it did not matter what happened on the dance floor as long as I gave it my all. Having two upperclassmen to look up to and learn from is so amazing! I feel so blessed that I have had the opportunity to be in student-choreographed pieces, which is something that not many colleges offer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fall Dance Gallery has been great, but my work in the classroom &mdash; this semester, I&rsquo;m taking Dance Technique and Performance and Modern III &mdash; has left me even more inspired. Dancing at Muhlenberg has made me feel something that is rare, and that only happens if you are lucky enough to land upon it, which is a great sense of community and a shared love for art. In my Modern class I have many upperclassmen that I look up to and feel comfortable enough to ask questions and get advice. In my Technique and Performance class I feel even luckier to have 17 other people to support me and laugh with me &mdash; not only two times a week in the current class, but for the next four years and beyond. Lastly, I am so happy that I am in two pieces that have allowed me to meet fellow Muhlen-dancers and build new relationships.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is really nothing more to say except that, despite the stresses of being a new college student, my first semester here at Muhlenberg has provided me with so much more opportunity, friendship and learning than I had ever imagined.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

        Commedia dell&rsquo;Arte - Jillian
       </div>
       <p>
        Ciao ragazzi!
       </p>
       <p>
        While we take many studio classes here, one of the biggest appeals of the Accademia dell&rsquo;Arte in Arezzo is the opportunity to study commedia dell&rsquo;arte in its place of origin, Italy! So, I&rsquo;m here to tell you a little bit more about this art form&hellip;
       </p>
       <p>
        Commedia dell&rsquo;Arte, in the form that it is recognized for today, originated in Italy in the 1500s. In this art form, there are stock characters, which you can think of as similar to ones you might see on a modern day sitcom.
       </p>
       <p>
        These characters can be split up into three main groups: zanni (servants), masters, and lovers. Zanni tend to be clownish or foolish, while the masters are generally egotistical and the lovers are meant to drive the plot forward. The most famous zanni is Arlecchino, a character that I have been working on developing in class. &nbsp;Each stock character has a specific physicality that goes with them, and most of the characters wear masks, which is why the physicality is relied upon so much.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our commedia teacher, Michele, is so wonderful and good natured, but also makes us work very hard &ndash; I love his class so much! When he first taught us how to perform the physicalities for the different characters, he made it look so easy, but when we tried it, we realized how intricate each one really is. Each physicality truly engages your entire body. It is a good thing we had been working these muscles so much in our voice and movement classes, because it did a good job of preparing us for what was to come (even though we were still so tired and sore from our first few practice sessions!). We have started to get better at developing these as the semester went on, and it is so great to take on a challenge.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also been writing commedia scripts in class here.&nbsp; In one of our scripts, I am playing Isabella, a lover. She is a lot of fun to play because, although she does not get to wear a mask, she is ridiculously overdramatic. Getting to write lines for this character has been a blast! This week, we picked out costumes, and Michele had us do physical exercises in order to understand what our character might feel like trying to do the extreme things commedia requires you to do while under the constraints of traditional dress. My Isabella truly hated rolling around on the ground in her fancy skirt and trying to keep up with the physical demands while sticking to what was culturally expected of a proper woman in that time period.
       </p>
       <p>
        In mask making class (stay tuned for more information about that) I made an Arlecchino mask, so that I can continue developing that character. This servant character, or zanni, is very playful, mischievous, and over-the-top, which has been a nice contrast to the prim and proper Isabella.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stay tuned for more fun information about our commedia classes at the villa!
       </p>

        Last Call - Lauren 11/8/14
       </div>
       <p>
        It is already the last Moving Stories performance! Cheers to another successful production at Muhlenberg. I am blessed to be a part of this great experience. Not only have the other dancers been a pleasure to work with, but the audience also seemed very responsive to our work and the show as a whole! It is bittersweet to see this process come to an end.
       </p>
       <p>
        We just finished our final warm-up. Tonight was a little different&mdash;the crew did a dance for us that was essentially a montage of highlights from each piece. Always so funny! Then all of the performers came together in a circle, as we do before each performance, and &lsquo;pass the squeeze.&rsquo; It is nice to take a moment to be still, hand-in-hand with my friends, and center myself amongst all the excitement. There is so much energy and love pulsing through the circle. Then we do what we call &lsquo;shake-out&rsquo; to honor a particular group that has contributed to the concert such as those who are making their debut on the Muhlenberg stage, choreographers, and the crew, our beloved seniors, as well as get our energy surging before the curtain opens.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am so happy to have the support of my family, friends, and professors in the audience. I am also so glad to have shared the stage with many new faces. I would like to thank Karen Dearborn, the Muhlenberg Dance Department, the Costume Shop, the Crew, and of course Courtney Hunsberger once again for this beautiful experience!&nbsp;

        Anyone Can Close a Show - Dan 11/6/14
       </div>
       <p>
        Barely four days since we closed Anyone Can Whistle, and I can already feel the typical theatre kid &ldquo;Post-Show Depression&rdquo; setting in.&nbsp; Already, I feel myself throwing around foreign words such as &ldquo;free time&rdquo; and &ldquo;weekends.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the things that theatre at Muhlenberg teaches you is how to be incredibly organized, diligent, and of course, responsible about your time-management &hellip; and it&rsquo;s something you forget you are even doing so well until your show is over and your body is still in hyper drive, waiting for the next rehearsal that will not come for a long time.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        This show was an incredible experience that I was so blessed to have the opportunity to partake in.&nbsp; The cast, crew and entire production team are now some of my best friends&hellip; and we are all going bowling this week for some good old-fashioned friendly competition.&nbsp; The audiences laughed with us, cried with us, sang with us and left the show thinking more deeply &ndash; and that is all we can really ask for.&nbsp; The coveted show poster that once adorned the lobby of the Baker Center for the Arts now adorns the wall of my dorm room. One might ask: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that too big for your wall?!&rdquo; The answer?&nbsp; Probably, but it is so worth it.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        Anyone Can Close A Show, that&rsquo;s what they say&hellip; but I would not want to close a show with anyone other than the incredible people I became closer to throughout this process.&nbsp; There is nothing like taking a sledgehammer to the Miracle Rock during strike to quite give you closure on this experience.&nbsp; Thanks for taking this journey with me.
       </p>
       <p>
        &nbsp;Until next time!

        It&#039;s Just the Tip of the Ice&#039;BERG - Samantha
       </div>
       <p>
        The summer before I came to Muhlenberg College, I&nbsp;received a letter in the mail about dance auditions for the fall dance concerts, which would be coming up soon after the start of school. I will admit that, even though the letter said not to worry, I was a bit worried. But when it came time for auditions, I felt a sense of relief &mdash; which was crazy considering how stressed I was trying to survive my first week of college.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first round of auditions were for the Mainstage productions (
        <em>
         Master Choreographers
        </em>
        and
        <em>
         Moving Stories
        </em>
        ), and consisted of a lot of upperclassmen, while the later auditions were reserved for smaller-scale student-choreographed pieces. I was told beforehand that I shouldn&rsquo;t think of student-choreographed pieces as of lesser &ldquo;value,&rdquo; and that the most valuable experience for me at this point might actually be working with my peers. I have found that to be true. This semester I was cast in two fall
        <em>
         Dance Gallery
        </em>
        pieces, one choreographed by sophomore Megan Lawrence, and the other by junior Caitlin Fell.&nbsp;Both pieces are on the modern-contemporary spectrum, but they are very different pieces, and I truly love them both. It has been an amazing experience working with two student choreographers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been in many pieces throughout my short dance career, all of which have been choreographed by trained professionals. However, I have learned so much from my peers, who have actually been though the experience as a freshman dancer at Muhlenberg. Aside from learning choreography, the rehearsals consist of &ldquo;Muhlenlessons&rdquo; from people who have been in my position. I am so grateful that I went through the audition experience and that I am able to take away so much more than just learning dance. It is only the tip of the &ldquo;ice-BERG,&rdquo; and I cannot wait to see what else lies ahead.&nbsp;

        Tech Week - Lauren
       </div>
       <p>
        I cannot believe Moving Stories tech is already here! Last weekend each piece had an allotted time to work on the stage to add the finishing touches: lighting and spacing. Courtney has worked very hard to make her vision come to life. To say the least, I am very proud of her and how far we have come as a team. It feels great to be a part of a dance we can finally call complete!
       </p>
       <p>
        This week we have a series of dress rehearsals leading up to opening night! As much as we try, waiting backstage in our costumes and makeup, knowing we will be on stage momentarily makes it hard to sit still. We all struggle to hold in our excitement; and besides, we are dancers, we never sit still! When it was my turn to take the stage, a freshman friend turned to me and expressed how nervous and excited she was. As a junior, I remember my first time performing on the Muhlenberg stage for the first time. She brought a nostalgic smile to my face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        We took our positions, the lights came up, and we began to move. Not only is there something very empowering to me about performing on stage, but I am also honored to express Courtney&rsquo;s vision to an audience. Last night, I felt in the zone. As a cast, Courtney said that our energy and intention was the best it has ever been. Our performance will only improve from here. I look forward to the next dress rehearsals and of course opening night!

        Opening Weekend! - Dan
       </div>
       <p>
        And just like that, we had a sold-out house in the Empie Theatre and the overture was playing.&nbsp; There is nothing crazier than the first night in front of an audience. I think it is important to remember that theatre as an art form is written for performance.&nbsp; There is something truly transformative about a musical when it is taken from paper and put up in front of a crowd.&nbsp; Everything changes!&nbsp; Suddenly it is as if the show is in a conversation with a group of bystanders who are experiencing it just as much as the performers.&nbsp; This show has something to say, and when the audience is there in the moment with us, it finally has the platform to say it.&nbsp; Their laughs and applause sustain and encourage our energy and take it to new heights.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        Speaking of energy, the thing that our reviews from the Lehigh Valley Stage and the Morning Call have been raving about is the amount of pure energy that the cast puts into every performance of this show.&nbsp; I could not agree more.&nbsp; It speaks to the dedication the cast has to this material and to entertaining the audience. &nbsp;Before every performance, the cast gathers for a physical warm-up on stage, where we take some time to stretch and groove to some music.&nbsp; This is truly one of the tightest casts I have ever been in and performing alongside them is an honor.&nbsp; For me, the real &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; is not the miracle rock spouting water&hellip; it is getting to share this experience with so many talented performers.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of Muhlenberg&rsquo;s Mainstage shows get four to six performances &ndash;and we have been blessed with eight.&nbsp; We are incredibly excited to start our second weekend of performances &ndash; and especially excited to come back together as a cast!&nbsp; Make sure to come out and see this wacky show that is a complete blast for all involved.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t regret it!

        Final Showing - Lauren
       </div>
       <p>
        I cannot believe the third and final showing is already here! For the last time, gathered in the Dance Studio Theater, the dancers perform as the dance faculty and production crew provides student choreographers with final feedback. The dance community here at Muhlenberg is extraordinarily special, and I am so thankful to be a part of it!
       </p>
       <p>
        From what I understand, all the pieces are complete and just about performance ready. In Courtney&rsquo;s piece, we have made many adjustments since the last showing to specify movement and alter transitions to better depict Courtney&rsquo;s vision and message. We have played with the motifs and the major transition between the first and second section; we slightly changed the trajectory of the piece so the first section gives off a feeling of confrontation between dancers on stage, while the second is more reflective as we then confront the audience to pose a question. I look forward to seeing how the faculty perceives the changes! We have certainly been working very hard to specify the message and relay it in an efficient and engaging way.
       </p>
       <p>
        While we rehearse, the costume designer and seamstresses have been working diligently in the costume shop. Now that I have been measured and fitted, I have a costume! Just yesterday I bought tickets for my family! The reality that we are performing in two weeks has finally set in. Soon I have technical rehearsals on the Baker stage, during which we will space and light the piece. This process went so fast; I guess they do say time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun!

        Translating Memory to Choreography - Loren
       </div>
       <p>
        Hello everyone! This semester I will be blogging about my experience choreographing for the Fall Dance Gallery, formerly known as the Informal Dance Concert. This is my second experience choreographing at Muhlenberg; last year I made my first ever work for the inaugural Freshmen First Pieces Concert. There were so many freshmen interested in choreographing second semester that they gave us our very own concert! Last semester, my piece was about something that had happened to me&mdash;it was a very clear story with a beginning, middle, and end. This year, however, my subject is a little more abstract.
       </p>
       <p>
        After graduating high school, I took a gap year to study in Israel, and a military operation occurred while I was there. The events of this past summer reignited those memories, so I decided to base my movement on that theme. However, unlike last year where I prepared movement before the auditions, this year I went in a little bit more blind. What I mean is that I didn&rsquo;t choreograph anything before my first rehearsal, which was something I was a little bit nervous for. But, when I met with Teresa and Megan, two members of the dance faculty, they encouraged me to use a more improvisational and organic process this time around. Working this way has definitely been a challenge, but it has only led to an abundance of movement to choose from, because now I have four other brains and bodies creating with mine.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hope to see you at the show!

        one of Stephen Sondheim&rsquo;s earliest and most bizarre shows.&nbsp; Bringing this enormous production to life on the Empie stage is the challenge and the passion of the cast of 40+ performers, but it could not be done without the hard work of many other brilliant and dedicated people including our directors, choreographers, musicians, stage managers, and the costume, lighting, sound, and set crews.&nbsp; It is days like today, while watching lighting cues get set and props replaced and our enormous &ldquo;Miracle Rock&rdquo; rolling on, that I remember how much work has been done behind the scenes to make us look and sound the best we can!&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        It is hard to believe that only seven short weeks ago, we were just starting this process of diving into the satirical dream world of our bankrupt town that suddenly is flip-turned upside down when a miracle happens.&nbsp; Through long nights of blocking, choreography and music rehearsals, we developed a certain rhythm to our show in our home &ndash; the First Floor Rehearsal Hall.&nbsp; Now we have to break out of our comfort zone and readjust our spatial relations and motions to this new room where keeping your head up is probably the most important thing to remember.&nbsp; It is a challenge, and one that my fellow cast members and I thoroughly enjoy.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of the members of the ensemble take on different roles throughout the show &ndash; including &ldquo;cookies,&rdquo; townspeople, pilgrims, &ldquo;group A&rdquo; and &ldquo;group one.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Shout out to my fellow Group One members!).&nbsp; But playing so many roles can sometimes create quite an identity crisis.&nbsp; One of the things I have enjoyed most about this production is that our director, Beth Schachter, has constantly encouraged us to create our own characters, to establish firm relationships with each other, and to react to situations organically as our individual characters might.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a relief to be able to bring so much of our own creativity to this process &ndash; and creativity is something this cast is definitely not short on!&nbsp;&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        For me, the message of this show focuses on miracles &ndash; and how people are often hunting for them in the wrong places.&nbsp; At the end of our show, the song &ldquo;With So Little To Be Sure Of&rdquo; contains the lyric, &ldquo;Crazy business this, this life we live in. Can&rsquo;t complain about the time we&rsquo;re given.&rdquo;&nbsp; That sums up my feelings right now, as we head into the crazy business of tech week.&nbsp; Having the opportunity to work with such incredibly talented, dedicated and friendly people on this show is a miracle on its own.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t complain about this show at all &ndash; and I&rsquo;d highly encourage you to come out to see it!&nbsp; Our run is from Oct. 24 &ndash; Nov. 2. Get your tickets now, before they are all sold out! &nbsp;&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
        See you there!
       </p>
       <p>
        Yours,
       </p>

        Dance Concert First Showing - Lauren
       </div>
       <p>
        This past weekend marked our second Moving Stories showing! Moving Stories is Muhlenberg&rsquo;s first Mainstage dance production of the year, featuring choreography by upperclassmen dance majors.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of the dancers, student choreographers, dance professors, and production crew gathered in the Dance Studio Theatre to preview the show as it has progressed so far. Considering most choreographers aim to have their piece completed by this time, it was really exciting to see how everything has come together and how much improvement they have demonstrated since the first showing.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is evident that the student choreographers have crafted quality work, but what may not be so evident is the journey they took to get there. Each choreographer begins this process with a vision: something he or she feels adamantly passionate about and wishes to make a statement about through dance.
       </p>
       <p>
        As one of Courtney Hunsberger&rsquo;s dancers, I must say, the story she has inscribed on our bodies is very powerful. I am certain her message will make a strong impact on the viewer. Courtney&rsquo;s vision had to do with the idea of competition, particularly the ways in which we always feel in competition with one another. This may be different for everyone; competition may manifest during performance auditions or sporting tryouts, when applying for colleges, internships, or jobs, in the classroom, or even regarding beauty standards.&nbsp; Courtney posed the question to us: why do we feel the need for life to be a competition? Certainly a good question. We expressed our initial feelings and improvised with this in mind. Soon material started to develop from her passion; what was a strong feeling solidified into physical movement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the course of many rehearsals, Courtney taught us a series of athletic movement sequences. As we perfected them, we soon organized her movement into a story with a fully developed arc. We worked very hard to manipulate different phrases of movement, whether it be to make a piece travel, make it remain in place, or make an interactive duet or trio out of it, to add more flavor and texture to the movement in the context of her vision. It was quite a process; not everything worked out the first time. We had to do and redo, try and try again until the movement said exactly what she wanted it to say. We played with many different songs until we found one that complemented her work just right.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moving forward, after this past showing, considering the constructive criticism we received from the Dance Program faculty, we are mostly working on transitions. Now that the arc or skeleton has been framed, we are exploring how our dancing even in the in-between moments can be more dynamic. Our journey has been long but certainly fulfilling. Until the next and final showing we will continue to adjust movements and sequencing, and improve execution of these movements and our group chemistry until they are just right.
       </p>
       <p>
        As they say, so far, so good! It has been, as in my past two experiences, a pleasure working with Courtney! I look forward to our final presentation of the work, what our costumes will look like, and putting Courtney&rsquo;s work on the stage!

        Getting to Know Arezzo - Jillian
       </div>
       I&rsquo;m back to tell you a little less about school and a little more about Italy!

The Accademia dell&rsquo;Arte is located on a large hill overlooking the downtown area of Arezzo, Tuscany. Before I got to the program here, I thought that the villa was very close to town; I found out on my first night here that it is actually a 30 minute walk up and down hilly terrain. The first few times I walked into town to explore, it was very tiring. I have since gotten used to the walk, and decided that my calves are going to be spectacular by the time the semester is over!

Why, you may ask, does one want to go into town? Well, in addition to the casual slice of pizza, there is so much to do there! We found out what a culturally alive place Arezzo was the very first week, when one of our program coordinators, Monica, took us on a tour of the city. She showed us everything - inside the huge cathedral, some historical monuments and statues, and even the storefront where parts of the famous movie Life Is Beautiful were filmed. She also took this time to point out the train station and her favorite caf&eacute;s, restaurants and gelato places so that we would know where to go later in the semester.&nbsp;
Arezzo also has many traditions that I have gotten to experience. Every Saturday, there is an open market where all kinds of foods and goods are sold for reasonable prices. The first weekend of each month, there is a huge antique fair with what seems like hundreds of stands selling not only antiques, but handmade jewelry and art as well. Walking around the antique fair may have been my favorite experience in the downtown area so far.

ADA also has a graduate program in physical theatre, and we love to interact with the grad students! Sometimes they have class at the villa and share meals with us, and sometimes we go to see their presentations at their studio downtown. It is always a treat to share our work with them and to see what they have been learning in their classes.

The most memorable thing that has happened downtown was definitely the joust. (Yes, a literal, medieval joust. Crazy, right?!) It takes place in Arezzo each year, and every region of the town goes wild displaying their spirit in support of their knight. Flags wave on every part of every street, and everyone walking around is wearing a scarf with the colors of their region on it. All of the ADA students and I were sure to buy and wear them proudly and to take part in the joust traditions as much as possible. The joust not only included the knights on horses, but also involved gymnasts, flag twirlers, and musicians who marched through the streets in parades for days leading up to the joust. The Accademia bought all of us tickets months in advance, so we were lucky enough to experience this once in a lifetime event.

A few weeks later, three other students and I, including my fellow Muhlenberg tour guide and theatre office staff member Zoe, went to a gymnastics studio in town and took a free aerial acrobatics class! I had never tried anything like this before, but it was so much fun! It was a great way to complement the juggling and basic acrobatics tricks we have been learning in class.

More updates to come when I return from Fall Break!

        Ciao from Italy! - Jillian
       </div>
       <p>
        Ciao everyone! My name is Jillian, and I am blogging from the Accademia dell&rsquo;Arte in Arezzo, Italy! Each semester many junior Muhlenberg theatre and dance majors choose to study abroad at ADA, and come back with nothing but positive things to say about the program. After being here for four weeks, I can confirm that the wonderful rumors are true!
       </p>
       <p>
        I, along with ten other Muhlenberg students and five students from other colleges, make up the undergraduate physical theatre program at ADA. Here with us are twelve music students from Furman University in South Carolina. All of the students live on a villa, right upstairs from all of our classrooms, practice rooms, lounges, and the mensa, which is where we eat all of our meals with the faculty. All of our meals on weekdays are provided, and the kitchen staff (headed by the fun-loving cook, Ricardo) makes the most delicious meals using only the freshest ingredients. The villa was built in the 1400s, and while it has been updated since then, it still has a beautiful, old-fashioned vibe. From the windows of our dorm rooms and classrooms, you can see the rolling hills of the Tuscan countryside and the cathedral in the downtown area of Arezzo. Sounds like a dream, right? I&rsquo;ve been here for a month, and still have not gotten over the view. Sitting outside to watch the sunset over Tuscany is one of the best parts of each day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Surprisingly enough, Muhlenberg students do not just go to ADA to witness the beauty of Italy. Coming to the Accademia is a great way to continue your acting training while getting an abroad experience. Our core performance classes are Movement, Voice, and Commedia dell&rsquo;Arte. Movement is exactly what it sounds like; we work on becoming aware of all of the things our bodies are capable of, and finding out how we can relate this to characters we will play onstage in the future. Our voice class is taught by Kevin Crawford, who was a guest artist at Muhlenberg two years ago and directed the mainstage production of
        <em>
         Bartholomew Fair
        </em>
        . In this class, we use our bodies to help us free our voices, both for speaking and for singing. Commedia dell&rsquo;Arte is a newer class we have started, in which we study a traditional form of theatre that uses stock characters, improvisation, and masks to tell stories. I will explain this more in depth in a later blog post.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to performance classes, all theatre students are required to take Italian and Philosophy courses as well. These have really helped me to feel more involved in the Italian culture, and have raised some important questions about why it is important to create art.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are also many smaller courses that meet fewer times throughout the semester, but are still very important and fun! We had a few juggling workshops, and many of the students here picked up three ball juggling very quickly, along with some other fancy tricks! ADA also focuses on circus traditions, and throughout the semester we will be working on headstands and some light acrobatics to add to our juggling expertise! Another small unit is a dramaturgy class in which we learn how to write commedia scripts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hope this basic overview helped explain what generally happens at the Accademia dell&rsquo;Arte! I cannot wait to blog some more about classes, the traditions of Commedia dell&rsquo;Arte, group travel adventures, and other important villa happenings! (And of course, pizza and gelato!)
       </p>

        Circus Workshop Tech Week! -- by Lea
       </div>
       <p>
        This weekend brings the end of the first Muhlenberg Circus Workshop. We have spent this past semester working collaboratively and creating an incredible show. With two shows on Friday at 5:30 and 7:30 that are already sold out, our waiting list is growing every day and its so encouraging knowing that our friends support all of our hard work. But don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t have tickets for Friday&rsquo;s shows! We will be having an Open Tech Rehearsal tonight at 9:00. It&rsquo;s free, so make sure you get there early enough to get a seat!
       </p>
       <p>
        As we work our way through tech week, the show keeps getting better and better. On Tuesday we had our first run-through with the lighting. The lighting designers have managed to turn the small space in Brown Studio into a magical arena fit for a circus. The lighting highlights all the exciting and breathtaking moments throughout the show, giving them an extra sparkle. Lighting is so important when creating an atmosphere and we have managed to make our own intimate world.

        Tonight&rsquo;s last tech rehearsal will be the first rehearsal with all of the elements put together. The lighting will be set, the costumes donned, and our fabulous make-up artists will complete the look of the world we&rsquo;ve created. The make-up designs are all together whimsical and magnificent. They are the perfect finishing touches to our characters.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know I speak for myself and the rest of the cast when I say you do not want to miss this show! It has been such an incredible experience and we would love to share it with our friends!

        Feeling Inspired -- by Loren
       </div>
       <p>
        I finally finished my piece for the First Pieces concert! I don&rsquo;t know why, but all of my best dance ideas come to me right as I close my eyes and snuggle up under the covers. Usually, I think about it for a few moments and decide if it is worth writing down, which it usually is, because like I said, they always end up being my best thoughts. Some people do their best thinking on the toilet, I guess fate just really doesn&rsquo;t want me to sleep. Because of this, I started keeping my dance notebook on a desk right under my bed, so I don&rsquo;t even have to get out of bed to reach it. That brilliant idea came to me after one night when ideas just kept coming and I got out of and back into my bed about four times. One of my childhood dance teachers gave me the idea of having a notebook set aside just for dance ideas, because she always said you never know when you will get inspired.
       </p>
       <p>
        And this weekend was full of inspiration. On Thursday night I attended the annual production of student works called Dance Emerge. I was able to attend on opening night, when the energy is most vivacious, and the dancers are eager to perform all that they have been working on. It was fascinating to see how choreographers changed just from last semester&rsquo;s Informal Dance Concert to this one. Some students worked in completely different styles, and others are really beginning to make their mark in a certain genre. Watching Dance Emerge I felt excited to see my own choreographic endeavor hit the stage in only two short weeks!
       </p>
       <p>
        &nbsp;Because of Dance Emerge, I had to reschedule my rehearsal to Friday afternoon right before a mandatory modern master class. A few of my dancers were also in Dance Emerge, so I knew that we wouldn&rsquo;t be running the piece full out at all. But, I made the best of the situation and experimented with the ending that I had come up with in bed the night before. Magically, the last chord of music hit just as they were melting into the final movements; I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for better timing. But I don&rsquo;t want to jinx myself! Today, my senior choreographic mentor, Annie, arranged a meeting for me to work with one of her friends, Ben, who is a GarageBand genius. I needed his help because my piece uses two different sections of music, and I needed to put them together on one track and add a cross-fade to connect them. I clicked on GarageBand for the first time a few nights ago, and basically just stared at the screen. I did manage to drag both tracks in, but when I tried to merge them, a chunk of one disappeared and then they were both playing at the same time. It was a failure, and so I asked Annie to help. Ben was a wiz; he merged my songs in about 15 minutes, and now I have a (hopefully) finished track! I say hopefully because my next rehearsal is Wednesday, and I don&rsquo;t want to get too excited until I make sure that it works with my dancers. This weekend was full of dance excitement, as I am sure these next two weeks will be as well.

        Seeing and Believing -- by Loren
       </div>
       <p>
        This past Sunday was the showing for the Freshman First Pieces Concert. A showing is when all of the choreographers, dancers, production manager and artistic director sit down together and watch the pieces for the first time. My fellow choreographers and I were experiencing every emotion under the sun: nervousness, excitement, fear, and pride. We were about to exhibit our first of hopefully many works of our Muhlenberg careers! Finally all of us gathered in the Dance Studio Theatre, which functions as both an everyday studio and a performance venue for the smaller, more intimate showcases.
       </p>
       <p>
        My favorite part about showings is getting the opportunity to see my fellow dancers outside of class. As much as we push ourselves to dance bigger and better every day, there is always an added spark when people are dancing for an audience. It was wonderful to see my friends move in ways that I had never seen them move before. After the last piece had finished, my fellow choreographer Emily turned to me and said, &ldquo;Wow, this is going to be a good show!&rdquo;
       </p>
       <p>
        After the pieces had been shown, all of the choreographers were given individual feedback from our artistic director, as well as three senior MDA board members. This year, the artistic director of Freshman First Pieces is Megan Flynn, the newest addition to the faculty here. I actually had Megan as a ballet teacher for Dance Technique and Performance last semester, and it is exciting to be taking this journey of firsts together. Each freshman choreographer was assigned a senior mentor who has taken advanced dance composition and serves on the Muhlenberg Dance Association board, and at the showing they had some really valuable things to say. A piece of advice that really stuck out to me was when Ally Berger, one of the senior mentors, said, &ldquo;You have a lot of vocabulary, but is it in the same dictionary?&rdquo; Thinking about movement this way really blew my mind.
       </p>
       <p>
        This past weekend was also the Senior Showcase, a venue for graduating students to perform originally choreographed solos. The performances were daring and emotional; we certainly have big shoes to fill.
