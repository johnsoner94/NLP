          A Muhlenberg education develops each individual's capacity  for a life of leadership and service by challenging and strengthening mind,  spirit, character, and community. We believe the College's faculty, students,  staff, trustees, and alumni share and contribute to the following values.  Accordingly, these values should guide and inform those engaged in the  College's strategic planning process as we identify goals, develop strategic  initiatives, and set priorities.
         </p>
         <p>
          &nbsp;
          <strong>
           I. Commitment to  the Life of the Mind
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We believe that liberal education integrates  experiences both within and beyond the classroom, and provides students with  the passion and tools for self-initiated and self-directed life-long learning.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Muhlenberg demonstrates an unusually strong  dedication to teaching. This is reflected in the faculty's rigorous  intellectual standards, pedagogical expertise, and close relationships with  students, and in the balance of academic challenge and personal support that we  offer our students.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We value vigorous and open-minded debate within  the context of civility.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We insist upon intellectual integrity and  personal accountability.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We value critical independent thinking and  reject intellectual orthodoxy.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We believe in the fundamental importance of  research and the creation of new knowledge for the intellectual vitality of  both faculty and students.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We believe that the life of the mind embraces  both analytical and creative effort.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We believe that liberal education should nurture  both the capacity for independence and the ability to work collaboratively with  others.
           <strong>
            <br clear="all" />
           </strong>
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          <strong>
           II. Commitment to Spirit and Character
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We acknowledge the value and power of spiritual  life, as well as our individual limitations in achieving absolute understanding  of truth. &nbsp;Accordingly, we respect and  show active interest in and concern for both our own and other faith traditions,  and we respect the views of those who do not identify with any faith.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We believe that honesty, integrity, and  truthfulness should characterize both our public and private behavior, and that  the development of ethical standards is an important component of liberal  education.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We value the physical well being of ourselves  and others, as well as the important life lessons that can be learned from  healthful physical activity.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We are committed to self-improvement and strive  openly and actively for ever higher standards of excellence in all areas of  endeavor.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We realize that pushing ourselves to stretch our  personal limits of knowledge and understanding will sometimes result in failure  and that failure provides opportunities for personal growth.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          <strong>
           III. Commitment to the Life of the Community - On Campus  and Beyond
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We treasure a distinctive campus climate characterized  by warmth, friendliness, a strong sense of community, and close relationships  among students, faculty, and staff.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We demonstrate mutual respect for differing  ideas, perspectives, experiences, and personal identities.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We strive to function as a caring community,  demonstrating concern for and offering support to each other, while challenging  each other to excel.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We reject as unacceptable behavior characterized  by violence, malice, disrespect, indecency, or contempt for others.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We are committed to developing a campus culture  in which fairness, equality, human diversity, and justice are successfully  integrated with the healthy clash of ideas and beliefs.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We acknowledge our obligation to be good  neighbors and good citizens, particularly in the Lehigh Valley, and to improve  the lives of those inside and outside our community who have less access to  education and political power, fewer privileges and resources, and who bear the  burden of discrimination.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           We are committed to being good citizens of the  Earth, and to making institutional decisions that are mindful of our complex  relations with the ecosystem.
