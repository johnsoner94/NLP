            The mission of the Muhlenberg College Multicultural Center is to serve as a campus-wide resource that facilitates and promotes a learning community of multicultural understanding and exchange through collaboration, dialogue, and action.&nbsp; Under the collaborative direction of an Advisory Board comprised of students, faculty, staff, parents, alumni, and friends, the Center is committed to promoting and sustaining an inclusive atmosphere that fosters and enriches multicultural understanding among all members of the Muhlenberg and Lehigh Valley community.&nbsp; Through partnerships with other campus programming bodies, the Center supports and provides a focus for educational, cultural, and social programming that enriches and challenges Muhlenberg&rsquo;s campus on issues of multiculturalism and difference.&nbsp; The Center aims to provide a supportive and safe space on campus for its multicultural students, faculty, and staff, and works to challenge acts of prejudice and ideologies of intolerance while seeking to advocate for all marginalized communities and cultures visible on Muhlenberg&rsquo;s campus.&nbsp; The Center strives to nurture and promote the academic success and leadership development of multicultural students at Muhlenberg.&nbsp; The Center also aids in strengthening Muhlenberg&rsquo;s connection with the Lehigh Valley community by initiating and supporting related events and programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

           </p>
           <p>
            The Muhlenberg College Multicultural Center will serve as a resource for our current campus community, a magnet for a growing multicultural population on campus and as an interface with the local Lehigh Valley community.&nbsp; These concurrent goals are best served by an Advisory Board composed of representatives of those stakeholder communities who are invested in the success of the Center.&nbsp; At the behest of the College, the Center board will have responsibility for the programming, marketing, staffing, resource development and, with the College administration, the assessment of the Center.&nbsp; The board will intentionally represent the diversity of cultures served by the Center.&nbsp; Board membership will be comprised of members of the Muhlenberg College community in its broadest sense.&nbsp; The Advisory Board will be drawn representatively from Muhlenberg College administration, staff, alumni, faculty, parents, students, and members of the Lehigh Valley community.&nbsp;
           </p>

            1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Existing initiatives:
           </p>
           <p>
            &sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IMPACT Project: A program that runs each semester that enables Muhlenberg students and Allentown youth currently on probation to form meaningful mentoring relationships.&nbsp; The group meets on the Muhlenberg campus each week and a Multicultural Center would be a great venue to host the program a few times a semester.&nbsp; This opportunity would help to motivate them to continue their current education and perhaps motivate them to pursue further education.
           </p>
           <p>
            &sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Casa Guadalupe: A local Hispanic community center that currently runs a program for elderly Allentown citizens.&nbsp; The Multicultural Center would be a great host site for a few activities as it would provide the senior citizens a comfortable location to meet and it would provide both the elderly and Muhlenberg students the opportunity to share with each other from their differing perspectives and world experiences.&nbsp; Programs could include the senior citizens and students cooking a meal together to share as a cultural experience with other Muhlenberg students.
           </p>
           <p>
            2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implement new initiatives:
           </p>
           <p>
            &sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dieruff High School: A number of students in the Comunidad Latina organization have invested much thought and action into beginning a program with students at Dieruff High School. &nbsp;The Multicultural Center would provide a great, relaxed venue for Muhlenberg students to expose Dieruff students to a college campus and to provide an SAT and college preparation program.
           </p>
           <p>
            &sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ESL site: The Center as a facility will provide a site appropriate for hosting varied community programs as needs arise.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, should a need arise for a new site for an ESL class, the Center would be a great location especially since many Muhlenberg students already volunteer on various sites in Allentown.
           </p>

             Assessment:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The activities and programs of the Multicultural Center will be assessed on an ongoing and annual basis by the Advisory Board.&nbsp; The assessment will include, but not be limited to, the following:
           </p>
           <br />
           <ol start="1" type="1">
            <li>
             Tracking programs, attendance at programs, and student/faculty reaction to programs in order to assess the success of Center programming.
            </li>
            <li>
             Surveying multicultural students annually to invite feedback about Center events and&nbsp; programming, Center&rsquo;s facilities, and Center&rsquo;s integration of co-curricular, extra-curricular and curricular life.
            </li>
            <li>
             Surveying selected faculty/staff members annually to seek feedback about Center events and programming, and facilities.
            </li>
            <li>
             Soliciting perceptions and feedback from other college programming bodies about the integration of the Center with their programming agenda.
            </li>
            <li>
             Surveying selected faculty and College administration to invite feedback regarding the extent to which the Center facilitates and assists in curriculum development, expansion, and revision.
            </li>
            <li>
             At some points, not necessarily annually, the surveys of students and faculty/staff should also seek to obtain feedback about the Center&rsquo;s contribution to a campus culture that is more understanding of and supportive of difference.&nbsp; The Center will need some time to work toward a campus culture that embraces and celebrates difference&mdash;and this may prove to be a journey that is ongoing and a destination never fully reached&mdash;but at some point there should be an attempt made to assess the Center&rsquo;s impact on campus culture.&nbsp; Focus group work might aid in this assessment in addition to survey work.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            It may well be that as the Center becomes established at Muhlenberg, other assessment techniques (or topics for assessment) will present themselves.&nbsp; The Advisory Board will be the body primarily charged with evaluating the Center&rsquo;s progress and setting the parameters for additional assessment.&nbsp; The College administration will be the final voice in evaluation of Center personnel, programming success, etc.
