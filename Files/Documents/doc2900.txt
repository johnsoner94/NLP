                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                As soon as you have selected a class, you should register for it.Registering early works to your advantage in two ways:
               </p>
               <ol>
                <li>
                 - Seating in courses is on a first-come, first-served basis.&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                 - Courses can be cancelled for lack of enrollment if we don&rsquo;t know about your interest.&nbsp; We typically make decisions two weeks prior to the beginning of class.
                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                TIP: The best way to ensure your place in a class is to register at least three weeks prior to the beginning of class.&nbsp;

                Tuition and fees are payable upon course registration.Muhlenberg College accepts payment via cash, check, MasterCard or Visa and American Express. You will NOT be able to register if you have an outstanding balance on your account (tuition, parking or library fines).

                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                You can change your schedule using the same type of enrollment request form you use to initially register. This may be done at any time prior to the conclusion of the add/drop period of the session for which you have enrolled. Consult the academic calendar and course listings for specific details. The academic calendar and other information pertaining to course selection can be obtained online at our Web site:
                <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/wescoe/">
                 www.muhlenberg.edu/wescoe
                </a>
                , or at the Wescoe School office.
               </p>
               <p>
                To add/drop, change or withdraw from a course, you must do so in writing, by completing an enrollment request form. You will continue to be held academically and financially accountable for the course(s) for which you enrolled until you are officially removed from the class roster. Please do not think you will be removed from the roster by not showing up for class, or by telephoning us to convey your intent.&nbsp;The Wescoe School will accept a faxed, signed letter of withdrawal if it is more convenient (fax: 484.664.3532).

                 6. What is the difference between &ldquo;dropping&rdquo; a course and &ldquo;withdrawing&rdquo; from a course?
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                The add/drop period is the time in which you may receive up to a 100% tuition refund, minus a $25 drop fee unless you simultaneously add another class. Usually, the add/drop period is assigned to the first week of class. Upon dropping a class, your academic transcript will not reflect the dropped class. After the close of the add/drop period, you must officially &ldquo;withdraw&rdquo; from a course with the approval of your academic advisor. A &ldquo;W&rdquo; will be assigned to your academic record indicating that you have withdrawn from the course. The timeliness of your withdrawal determines how much, if any, tuition refund you receive.

                Department Heads and Program Directors set the course enrollment limits when planning the Master Course Schedule. If the course closes during registration, a student wanting to enroll in the course must seek the approval from the Department Head or Program Director. During the add/drop period, the instructor may allow a student into a closed course by signing the add/drop form.

                Courses in which the student earns a grade of &ldquo;B-&rdquo; or higher cannot be repeated. If a student repeats a course, all grades for the course are calculated into the GPA and listed on the academic record; however, only the course earning the first passing grade is counted toward the 34 course units required for graduation.

               <p>
                Knowing what courses you need ahead of time is important so that you can take them when they become available in the course schedule. There may be times, however, when a course is simply unavailable and has been for some time. Speak to your academic counselor about your status as soon as possible. He/she may offer to you the option of taking the course during the day, or give you information about the possibility of taking the course as a &ldquo;Special Arrangement,&rdquo; designed in consultation with a faculty sponsor.&nbsp;Also, it may be possible for you to take a class at another accredited academic institution; however, you should discuss the matter with your advisor beforehand due to limitations on the type and number of classes that can be transferred.

               </p>
               <p>
                Like a &ldquo;Special Arrangement&rdquo; &nbsp;course, an &ldquo;Independent Study/Research&rdquo; course is negotiated with a faculty sponsor. The difference between a Special Arrangement and Independent Study/Research course is that the latter normally does not cover the same material or material similar to that covered in regularly offered courses. No more than one course unit is awarded for each independent study/research course, and no fewer than 9 &ndash; 12 hours of work per week are required. It must have assigned letter grades, A &ndash; F.

                 13. What is a course unit and the difference between a course unit and a semester credit hour?
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Muhlenberg College uses a course unit system intended to emphasize the mastery of subject matter in contrast to the credit system which measures achievement in terms of time spent in class. A course as a unit of instruction may include a combination of lecture, discussion, recitation, computer work, group projects and laboratory work. The course is the entire learning experience, not merely the time spent in the classroom. Such an approach delegates to students greater responsibility for their own education and encourages active learning. Many institutions may not use a course unit system similar to Muhlenberg&rsquo;s. For the purpose of all transfer transactions, the Muhlenberg course unit should be considered equivalent to 4 semester credit hours.

The student is required to complete and submit the required work within sixty (60) calendar days of the end of the term to prevent conversion of the incomplete &ldquo;I&rdquo; to a grade of &ldquo;F.&rdquo;

                Full-time, degree-seeking students who have completed at least 16 Muhlenberg College units with a cumulative GPA of 2.00 or more may elect to enroll for one course unit per semester on a pass/fail basis up to a total limit of three courses. One of the three pass/fail courses may be taken in the same academic division as the student&rsquo;s major or minor, but not within the discipline of the major or minor program itself, even if the student has completed all the requirements for the major or minor Muhlenberg College is divided into three academic divisions:

                In addition, no course for which a student elects to enroll on a pass/fail basis may be used to satisfy a general academic requirement (GAR). Courses offered by the college with a &ldquo;pass/fail only&rdquo; designation are exempt from the pass/fail requirements described here. Courses enrolled on a pass/fail basis that are awarded a grade of &ldquo;P&rdquo; (equivalent to a traditional &ldquo;D&rdquo; or higher) will not be used in computing the GPA but will be counted as course units toward graduation; courses failed will be computed in the GPA. Students may change a course from pass/fail to traditional grading or vice-versa only in the add/drop period of the semester. Pass/fail grades are not allowed in the Summer Sessions.

               <p>
                Ordinarily, students auditing a course are expected to complete all assigned reading and participate in class discussions but will not be required to submit written work or take exams. Students in good academic standing may audit one class per semester with the instructor&rsquo;s approval. Instructors must explicitly detail their expectations for students auditing their courses at the beginning of the semester, specifying &lsquo;Conditions of the Audit&rsquo; on the audit registration form, and students must seek the consent of their faculty advisor. Students may change a course from audit (no course unit attempted) to a regular course unit basis (graded) or vice versa during the add/drop period, with the approval of the instructor and the faculty advisor. The student&rsquo;s transcript will list the audited course with a grade of &ldquo;AU&rdquo; if the student has satisfactorily completed the audit. If the student fails to fulfill the requirements of the audit, no notation will appear on the transcript.

The instructor must complete a grade change form with the student&rsquo;s new grade and reason for the change, and then submit the form to the Dean of the Wescoe School for signature. The Dean will forward the form back to the Registrar&rsquo;s office and a REVISED grade report will be sent to the student&rsquo;s home address.

               <p>
                Outstanding academic achievement will be recognized by the Dean of the College each semester. Students enrolled for 3 or more course units, having a term GPA of at least 3.500 with no grades of D, F, U, or VF for the semester will be eligible for Dean&rsquo;s List. Students with an incomplete grade will not be eligible for inclusion on the Dean&rsquo;s List until the work is completed and a final grade is recorded.

                &nbsp; The Wescoe School assesses work experience on a case-by-case basis. Adult learners bring a lifetime of learning from their workplace to the classroom. Much of this experience can be directly applied to college-level credit. The American Council on Education (ACE) recommends baccalaureate credit for career&ndash;focused education provided by certain companies, societies, associations, and institutions. We call this training &ldquo;Credit for Prior Learning.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
                It is advantageous for you to speak to your academic advisor about any career training you have received and/or career examinations that you have passed. Ultimately, your advisor will need specific documentation from the company administering such training to determine its college credit-worthiness. Specifically, you will need to obtain:

               <ol>
                <li>
                 - The number of hours you attended
                </li>
                <li>
                 - Course description about the type of training/examination
                </li>
                <li>
                 - Certificate or proof of achievement written by the administering company
                </li>
                <li>
                 - Information about whether or not you had to take an examination to receive the certificate of achievement.
