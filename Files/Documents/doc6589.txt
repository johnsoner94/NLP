             FRN 301 Communication and Cultural Understanding
             <br />
            </strong>
            This course provides intensive practice in conversational French, centered on cultural aspects of the French-speaking world. French and Francophone movies serve as the thematic backdrop for in-class discussions, oral presentations, and papers emphasizing correct usage of French linguistic and grammatical structures. This course also focuses on understanding the nuances of advanced French grammar, stylistic expressions, and conversational strategies. Students learn strategies for cultural understanding that will allow them to explore and adapt to modern Francophone cultures. Offered fall semester. Prerequisite: FRN 204 Intermediate French II.

             FRN 304 Approaches to Textual Analysis
             <br />
            </strong>
            This course emphasizes formal writing skills necessary for advanced courses in French, including critical analysis, information literacy and research techniques. Advanced grammar study, translation, and vocabulary building are additional aspects of this course, since many of the errors that students at this level make in their speaking / writing stem from inaccurate translations from English. Throughout the semester, students will be reading and discussing authentic French and Francophone cultural texts in order to improve upon their ability to engage with and meaningfully respond to the different writing genres studied in the course. Offered spring semester. Prerequisite: FRN 204 Intermediate French II.

             FRN 310 French for the Professions
             <br />
            </strong>
            Using applications from the real world, this course introduces students to professional uses of French in France and the francophone world. Contacts with local professionals, both inside and outside of the classroom, allow students to explore the numerous possibilities of using their French linguistic and cultural knowledge beyond the academic area (such as working for companies with international offices, working with global health agencies, providing translation services, working in international law, and so forth). Moreover students will apply the strategies they learned in their French studies to a service-learning project with the Allentown community. This course focuses on acquiring the proper writing, analytical, and oral presentational skills necessary to succeed in a career using French. In addition to linguistic training, students create an on-line portfolio that will prepare for their future career. Offered in alternate spring semesters. Taught in French. Prerequisite: FRN 204 Intermediate French II.

             FRN 313 French Theater of Resistance
            </strong>
            .
            <strong>
             &nbsp;
             <br />
            </strong>
            The French hold dear the notion that in times of trouble they have always summoned up the courage to resist the oppressor. That resistance may take many forms: resisting tyranny, social conformity, one's own destructive impulses, the uncertainty of our existence in the universe. French playwrights such as Corneille, Racine, Marivaux, Beaumarchais, Hugo, Jarry, Sartre, Beckett, and more recently, Yasmina Reza, have captured the dramatic force of this resistance in their theatre. The course surveys major moments in the history of French theatre and emphasizes literary analysis of the plays. Taught in English. Meets general academic requirement L and effective Fall 2013 HU.

             <br />
            </strong>
            French history has long been marked by revolutions of various kinds, the most famous of course being the French Revolution of 1789. What is it about the French political and cultural spirit that has sparked these revolutions? In this course, we will investigate this revolutionary spirit across the centuries, beginning in the 18th century and traveling through time into May 1968 and the current strikes and protests that continually appear in the news. We will analyze in particular the cultural medium in which these revolutions occur, such as theatrical presentations, novels, manifestos, pamphlets, newspapers, films, and art. Course may count as 300-level course for French major or minor if students read texts in French (where applicable) and write all papers in French. Taught in English.

             <br />
            </strong>
            This course examines the situation of French residents, especially youth, whose family immigrated to France from North and Sub-Saharan Africa, the French-speaking Caribbean and Asia. They frequently find that they are caught between two worlds, struggling to be accepted as fully French but wanting to understand their African, Caribbean or Asian cultural heritage. Often not considered French, despite their French citizenship, they suffer from&nbsp;racial prejudice, whether on the streets, in the workplace, or in the&nbsp;education system. In addition to these difficulties are the clashes between the culture of their parents&rsquo; native countries and the principles and values of the French Republic. Through an examination of novels by contemporary authors (Azouz Begag, Gis&egrave;le&nbsp;Pineau,&nbsp;Kim Lef&egrave;vre), several&nbsp;sociological studies,&nbsp;

            In this course students will explore the founding and development of Quebec, focusing particularly on the themes of memory and myth in the creation of Quebec's identity.&nbsp; Quebec's motto, "Je me souviens" (I remember) clearly establishes this pattern of relying on memory - and the myths that evolve from those memories - in order to distinguish the Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois cultural identity from the surrounding anglophone majority.&nbsp; Students will explore political speeches, cultural artifacts, literary texts, films, and media within their historical and cultural context, arriving at an understanding of today's culturally vibrant and diverse Quebec.&nbsp; Taught in French.&nbsp; Prerequisites FRN 301 and 304.

             <br />
            </strong>
            This course examines texts written by French-speaking women writers from Africa and the Caribbean, exploring ways in which these writers seek to identify themselves in relation to their male counterparts as well as to the predominantly European literary models available to them. The degree to which these writers choose to accept or reject these literary traditions suggests certain cultural perspectives unique to the post-colonial Francophone world. Our analyses will include historical and cultural overviews of each region, and reflect upon the representation of contemporary gender issues in these literary works. Taught in French.

             <br />
            </strong>
            In this course, we will study the rise, fall and legacy of the French Empire from the middle of the nineteenth century through the decolonization era to the postcolonial financial, political and cultural institutions that govern France&rsquo;s relationship with francophone countries in today&rsquo;s globalized world.&nbsp; Through the study of historical, anthropological, sociological and literary texts, film, music and the arts we will explore the following themes: the economic and political pressures that made the imperial project viable in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; the rise of anti-Semitism in France and its relevance to larger debates on Empire and race; the military, social and cultural role French colonies played in both World Wars; post-World War II independence movements within the context of the Cold War; and, finally, the specific challenges with which the processes of globalization have presented different areas of the francophone world in the last thirty years (debt, civil war, migrations, women&rsquo;s rights issues, etc.).

            </strong>
            The theme of the class is representations of Otherness, Strangeness and Alterity in the French-speaking world from the Middle Ages to the present day. We will be looking at figures of the &ldquo;Other&rdquo;&nbsp;not only as stranger, outsider or outcast but also as the articulation of difference within ourselves as individuals or members of a community. This course will invite students to think of otherness, foreignness and alienation in culturally and historically defined ways.&nbsp; It will also encourage them to think critically about rhetorical and thematic specificities as we consider otherness in texts belonging to different genres.&nbsp; Taught in French.
