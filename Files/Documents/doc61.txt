             CAMPUS&nbsp; SAFETY

            <li>
             <strong>
              What does Campus Safety do?
              <br />
             </strong>
             Campus Safety is the focal point for providing a safe secure College community.&nbsp; Campus Safety is like a small community police department; they operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year and coordinate emergency response to any incidents on the campus. Officers are specially trained and patrol the campus by foot, on bicycle, and in vehicles. Students are encouraged to travel in groups; however, Campus Safety does provide an escort to and from academic and residential buildings in the evening.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              How do you provide building safety and security?
              <br />
             </strong>
             All Residence Halls have key card access so that if a student looses his/her card, the College can quickly deactivate it and ensure that security is not jeopardized.&nbsp; All Residence Halls and administrative buildings have fully operational sprinkler systems and hard-wired smoke detectors that ensure prompt alert of all residents for a timely evacuation.&nbsp; In addition, some administrative and academic buildings have closed-circuit television cameras that assist in monitoring access to the buildings and responding to problem situations.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              How do students or others contact Campus Safety?
             </strong>
             <br />
             Students can contact Campus Safety by telephone, computer, or through personal contact.&nbsp; In addition, there are numerous emergency phones at strategic locations around campus that are identified by yellow Call Boxes with blue lights; they allow an individual to alert Campus Safety of a problem situation.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              What are your relationships with local law enforcement agencies?
              <br />
             </strong>
             The College has a long standing and very effective relationship of collaboration with both Allentown Police Department and Allentown Fire Department.&nbsp; We have worked with them on our crisis management plans and they have supported us on emergency situations and routinely assists us with support for major events.&nbsp; In addition, two Allentown Police Department officers patrol with Campus Safety officers in the neighborhood during the weekends and high activity times.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              What happens if a student gets in trouble?
             </strong>
             <br />
             The College understands that young people, often away from home for the first time, experiment both in terms of their beliefs as well as their behaviors.&nbsp; When serious incidents occur, Campus Safety normally conducts an investigation and the incident is adjudicated through the College Judicial System.&nbsp; The sanctions normally include consequences that allow students to learn from his/her experience and change his/her behavior.&nbsp; Selected students have a major role in the College Judicial System and help establish the standards for behavior on our campus.

              <br />
             </span>
             The majority of students who attend counseling at Muhlenberg College seek help with normal developmental issues regarding relationships with peers, parents, or other adults.&nbsp; Students who struggle with depression, anxiety, eating disorders and/or substance abuse also seek help through Counseling Services.

              The most common problems dealt with at Counseling Services are interpersonal relationship issues and the normal developmental issues of leaving home, adjusting to college, and preparing to leave college.&nbsp; Other issues frequently dealt with at Counseling Services include self-esteem, drug and alcohol use, anxiety, and depression.

              Students&rsquo; comments and records are confidential and are not shared with any non-counseling Muhlenberg College staff except in specific instances, including when the student is of danger to self or a danger to others, and when a student signs a written request that his/her records be shared verbally or in writing with other Muhlenberg College staff.

             <span>
              Parents are not informed if the student is attending counseling unless the student wishes them to be informed or if the student is considered to be a danger to self or others.

             The current fraternity &amp; sorority community is comprised of five women&rsquo;s fraternities and sororities and four men&rsquo;s fraternities. All eight organizations are affiliated with a national or international headquarters. This is important as the local chapter is able to receive direction and support from the headquarters and members become part of a vast network of brothers or sisters across the country.

              <br />
             </strong>
             Interested students are eligible to become a part of the community at the start of their sophomore year. Transfer students are required to provide a copy of their other school transcript in order to prove eligibility. Because academics are highly valued by all chapters, students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.50 to participate in formal recruitment week. Likewise, character and accountability are important qualities in members - individuals on disciplinary suspension are ineligible while students on probation must seek permission from the Inter-Fraternity Council or College Panhellenic Council to participate.

              What financial obligations are there to membership?
              <br />
             </strong>
             The financial obligation that accompanies membership differs among chapters. Each chapter is self-supporting and operates on the dues paid by its members. Dues cover items such as chapter supplies, social activities, insurance, composite pictures, new items for member use, leadership programs, philanthropy, and recruitment. Since some chapters operate their own residence, their dues structure may vary from a chapter that resides in college owned housing. Fees range from a couple hundred to several hundred dollars a year.

              <br />
             </strong>
             Recruitment Week is a one-week period in which the chapters host events to introduce eligible students to the fraternity/sorority community and the individual chapters. Eligible students have the opportunity to speak with chapter members, view chapter housing, and get a sense of the culture of each group. Participation in Recruitment Week is voluntary and does not obligate a student to join any of the chapters. At the end of the week, chapters issue formal invitations, called bids, to selected students.

              What about hazing?
              <br />
             </strong>
             The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the national headquarters of each chapter, and Muhlenberg College strictly forbid hazing activities. Allegations of hazing are dealt with swiftly and individuals or chapters found to be hazing suffer significant penalties. Hazing has no place in fraternal life. All members sign a statement obligating them to report hazing if they observe it or are subjected to it. Chapters are expected to continue to educate their members on what constitutes hazing and to develop programs that promote positive bonding experiences. It is important to note that, under Pennsylvania Law, no one can &ldquo;consent&rdquo; to be hazed.

              What is alcohol consumption really like in a fraternity/sorority?
              <br />
             </strong>
             All chapters are expected to uphold the laws of the Commonwealth and the City of Allentown as well as abide by College policies regarding alcohol. All chapters have implemented policies that strictly regulate alcohol distribution and consumption. For instance, the national organization for each of the women&rsquo;s fraternities prohibits them from hosting or co-hosting open functions where alcohol is served. The penalties for violating these policies are strictly enforced by each chapter&rsquo;s national headquarters and the College. This by no means should imply that the fraternity/sorority community doesn&rsquo;t have a good time; it means that the chapters have become smarter in managing their risks by exercising greater responsibility.

              Will being in a fraternity/sorority help or hinder my academic performance?
              <br />
             </strong>
             While each student is ultimately responsible for his or her own academic success, fraternal organizations can assist in the academic growth of their members. Many members report that their grades improve after joining because they are forced to learn better time management, have a readily accessible group to study with or learn from, and have access to chapter academic resources. Nationally, data indicates that students involved in fratnerity/sorority life have a greater chance of graduating.

              What are the benefits of joining a Greek-letter organization?
              <br />
             </strong>
             Simply put, there is an intangible, an essence, a vibe, a feeling, that runs through being a part of a Greek letter organization. I&rsquo;m not talking about just wearing letters and hanging out with people you like. For those who embrace the ideals and values of chapter life and live them out every day, "being Greek" has deep, profound meaning. But what are these ideals and values? - Scholarship, Leadership, Service, Character and Fraternity. When chapters put all the pieces together, fraternal life is a compelling and integral part of a student&rsquo;s life both at college and beyond.
             <br />
             <br />
             Muhlenberg College is fortunate to have a small, personal fraternity/sorority community that makes the likelihood of this happening even greater. The benefits to you are friendships, challenges, and changes that will positively affect you for a lifetime.

               <strong>
                Certain programs (i.e. education, pre-health professions) require careful advising to assure proper scheduling for the first and subsequent semesters.
               </strong>
               &nbsp; If no one subject area interests you more than another, think about taking a few of the General Academic Requirements.&nbsp; Remember, a liberal arts education is often best approached with a desire for exploration.

               <br />
               Do not worry about your placement in the proper level of courses.&nbsp; In subjects other than mathematics and foreign language, you will be placed in the introductory level unless you are extremely proficient (advanced levels of History or English, for example, if you've done well on the A.P. or I.B. exams).
               <br />
               <br />
               The advisors use the results of your Mathematics and Foreign Language Placement Exams to help determine your appropriate levels in mathematics and foreign language. However,&nbsp;
