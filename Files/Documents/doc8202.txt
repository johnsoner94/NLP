             202. Reading Emily Dickinson
            </strong>
            <br />
            Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s life, letters, and poems have attracted an unusually diverse set of &ldquo;labels.&rdquo; She is variously described as Romantic, Modern, Post-Modern, Puritan, anti-Puritan, feminist, anti-feminist, a victim of psychological disorders (agoraphobia, anorexia, depression), a victim of patriarchal oppression, a genius, a great ironist, and more. So Dickinson&rsquo;s poetry offers us much to negotiate in the course, ways of reading as well as readings of individual poems. We will have the advantage of abstracts of book-length Dickinson criticism written by members of a previous seminar, a sort of readers&rsquo; guide to Dickinson which we will expand. We will also study poems by two twentieth-century women writers, Elizabeth Bishop and Adrienne Rich, in light of Dickinson&rsquo;s legacy, and try to trace Dickinson&rsquo;s particular kind of &ldquo;nature&rdquo; poetry back to a seventeenth century tradition she admired.

             206. Reading Austen
            </strong>
            <br />
            This course explores the novels of Jane Austen and their contemporary revisions. Roughly half of the course consists of an intensive and historically-contextualized study of four of Austen&rsquo;s novels along with a reading of a biography of Austen. The other half consists of a cultural materialist study of the revisions, sequels, and film adaptations of Austen produced predominantly in the 1990s and 2000s. In this way, we explore the continuing importance of Austen to contemporary readers as well as the structure and significance of fan culture. In addition to several of Austen&rsquo;s original novels, texts and films may include Jon Spence,

            &mdash;in themselves and as they are transformed into a larger cultural &ldquo;Alice Myth&rdquo; with a life of its own. The course examines these texts in a variety of cultural and aesthetic frames. These are primarily British and Victorian, considering the
            <em>
             Alice
            </em>
            books as children&rsquo;s stories, as dream-texts, and as complexly

            representations of gender, class, childhood. In addition, the course will consider the relation between the texts and their author, who led a triple life as Charles Dodgson, Oxford don in mathematics, as the writer Lewis Carroll, whom Dodgson never acknowledged, and as one of the fathers of photography, a famous portrait photographer. In the latter part of the course we will pursue the afterlife of the Alice Myth, up to the present day. We will look at adaptations of the books, film versions by the surrealist Svankmajer and by Disney, and perhaps the video game based on the Alice books.

            <em>
             The Waste Land
            </em>
            is probably the most famous English-language poem of the twentieth century. On its completion, Eliot&rsquo;s editor and in some sense co-author, Ezra Pound, called it &ldquo;at 19 pages the longest poem in the English language (sic).&rdquo; Why? Because the poem is a curriculum as much as a poem. It enfolds a number of discourses: literature, economics, music, Buddhism, the Music Hall, etc. This course will ask students to read the books that lie behind Eliot&rsquo;s poem. These would include, in addition to the facsimile drafts of the poem, the books Eliot cites in his notes for the poem, the relevant English literature as well as Jessie Weston&rsquo;s work of cultural anthropology,
            <em>
             From Ritual to Romance
            </em>
            and works he doesn&rsquo;t cite but which he read and which influenced the poem, notably John Maynard Keynes&rsquo;

We will listen to and try to make sense of Wagner; certainly we will become aware of his overwhelming importance as the greatest artist of the nineteenth century and the long shadow he cast over Eliot&rsquo;s generation as instanced by the poem. We will read an account of the First World War, probably Erich Maria Remarque&rsquo;s

             214. Reading Whitman&rsquo;s America
            </strong>
            <br />
            This course will study the United States that Walt Whitman knew and interpreted in his writing. The first part will focus on the longer poems of
            <em>
             Leaves of Grass
            </em>
            , framing this work between the two poetic manifestos, &ldquo;Song of Myself&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry.&rdquo; The second will move between Whitman&rsquo;s poetry and other works, visual as well as verbal, that give testimony to the politics and culture of his time. When the Civil War broke out, Whitman worked in the battlefield hospitals as a nurse and produced the volume &ldquo;Drum Taps&rdquo; from this experience. We&rsquo;ll read several poems from this collection to investigate Whitman&rsquo;s visions of what the war meant and how it would impact the country&rsquo;s future. The course will show that Whitman&rsquo;s America wasn&rsquo;t a single place or culture but a dynamic of people, speech, custom, ideology, and a series of visions the poet had for the future of his ideal democracy. Texts for the course will include the 1855 edition of
            <em>
             Leaves of Grass
            </em>
            as well as single poems from subsequent editions, including &ldquo;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,&rdquo; &ldquo;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&rsquo;d,&rdquo; &ldquo;Passage to India,&rdquo; among others; readings in Mason Lowance&rsquo;s,

            In this course, students study the genre of the medieval romance, a genre which eventually gives rise to the novel. Through a focus on four literary texts, students explore the importance of literary structure, narrative voice, and the way that social and cultural values are foundational to the representation of the protagonist. The first two texts are a romance by Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes, the essential model of the medieval romance, and an additional English romance. The next reading,
            <em>
             Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
            </em>
            , puts chivalric and romance values into a more ironic context. Selected tales from the
            <em>

            </em>
            in Middle English highlight Chaucer&rsquo;s important transformation of romance conventions in the context of emerging bourgeois and mercantile social values as well as new understandings of authorship.

            </strong>
            <br />
            For two centuries, India was both &ldquo;the jewel in the crown&rdquo; of the British Empire and a bewilderingly complex civilization whose mysteries rendered it largely illegible to outsiders. In the sixty years since independence, a wide array of English-language writers have taken up the charge of representing India, both from within the subcontinent itself and from such far-flung sites of the Indian Diaspora as London, Trinidad, Toronto, and New York. This course will explore some of the more intriguing ways in which India has been represented by colonizers, natives, and first and second-generation emigrants alike, ranging from Kipling&rsquo;s &ldquo;city of dreadful night&rdquo; and E.M. Forster&rsquo;s acid depictions of British misfeasance in the late imperial period to the social comedies of R.K. Narayan, the dizzying experiments with magic realism of Salman Rushdie, and the cultural collisions recorded by such London-based writers as Hanif Kureishi and Monica Ali in the last decade of the twentieth century.

            This course will study how novelists, poets, and playwrights have treated the American South, and the extent to which they have challenged or fostered prevailing popular representations in songs and movies and political rhetoric (e.g. Dixie, down-home, Jim Crow, &ldquo;a civilization gone with the wind,&rdquo;).&nbsp; We will consider how these writers' work addresses what ideologues and historians have characterized as the "peculiar" political and social conditions that have made the South seem distinctive: slavery and its Jim Crow aftermath.

             243, 244. Genres of Popular Fiction
            </strong>
            <br />
            A study of the nineteenth century genesis and twentieth century development of three of the major genres of popular writing: mystery, horror, and science fiction. We will be reading not only particular works from these categories but theoretical essays on the nature of the genre itself. Authors will include: Poe, Lovecraft, Conan Doyle, Hammett, Chandler, Shelley, Le Guin, and others. This course will not only focus on reading popular literature and writing standard literary critical papers but will also examine literary genre as a category and ask students to write creatively within the specific literary genres&mdash;mystery, horror, romance, adventure, science fiction&mdash;studied by the course. In this way, the course will provide a thorough exploration (i.e. historical, theoretical, and practical) of the various modes of popular literary expression.

            <br />
            What is poetry? How is it made or constructed? Is it the product of sudden inspiration or of something more mundane? This course will address such questions by examining the work of poets who, in addition to their poems, have left behind letters, journals, and notebooks that allow us to reconstruct the processes through which their poems develop and progress to completion. Students will be encouraged to write and chart the development of their own poems in process.

             249, 250. Science Fiction and Fantasy
            </strong>
            <br />
            This course undertakes an in-depth and literary exploration of a few representative texts in the vast genre of Science Fiction/Fantasy. We pay special attention to the particular ways in which science fiction and fantasy engage with the concerns of the terrestrial present which produces them or in which they are read. We will consider science fiction as a literary exploration of historical, scientific, social, political, and personal issues under consideration by actual humans in the here (or near here) and now (or not so long ago). In particular, our syllabus highlights texts that think about ecology and bodily identity. We also consider Science Fiction/Fantasy as a literary form&mdash;a discourse with its own rules, methods, and history. Readings may include such works as &ldquo;Bloodchild&rdquo; by Octavia Butler,
            <em>
             The War of the Worlds
            </em>

            By tracing the development of evolutionary thinking in the poetry, fiction and science writing of Darwin&rsquo;s century, this course considers some of the ways science and other forms of culture inform each other. We pay particular attention to how evolutionary narrative shapes and is shaped by nineteenth century British conceptions of the individual, species, race, nation, sexuality, and nature. We will read Darwin in the original, as well as some of his influences, including Malthus and Paley, and much of the poetry, fiction, and popular science that helped build and disseminate evolutionary thinking, including Alfred Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Robert Louis Stevenson, and H. G. Wells.

            The course will explore the multiple relationships between word and image in a variety of interdisciplinary texts. We will examine the genres of illustration (poem and novel), composite text, ekphrasis, children&rsquo;s story, concrete and imagist poetry, the graphic novel, and film. Historically, the scope of the course is broad, reaching from the classical period to last year. We&rsquo;ll move from

            </strong>
            <br />
            This course examines stagings of Restoration England. The first half of the course investigates Restoration Comedy in historical and theatrical context. Likely themes include the relationship between theatre and politics, the intersection of nationality and sexuality, and the shift from aristocratic to bourgeois cultural forms. The second half of the course examines recent theatrical and cinematic representations of the Restoration era. We will look at contemporary productions of Restoration plays, new plays set in the Restoration era, and feature films. The Restoration emerges as a period of sex, fashion, class struggle, and nascent imperialism. What is at stake in these representations for our own historical moment? Why stage the past to address the present?

             329, 330. Nineteenth Century British Fiction: The Marriage Plot
            </strong>
            <br />
            This course will examine how novels in Britain represent and are constructed around the so-called marriage plot: the progression from courtship, through obstacles, to arrive at the altar&mdash;or not! This plot has always been popular for providing a scaffold for novels&mdash;witness the proliferation of shoddy romance novels on the shelves of supermarkets today. In this course, we will concentrate on how the marriage plot is figured during the nineteenth century in Britain, commonly thought of as the great age of the novel. We will be assuming that marriage is an institution that not only legitimizes and controls heterosexual desire but also guarantees the smooth transference of property and wealth from one generation to the next, the very cornerstone of patriarchal continuity. Texts may include Austen,

            <br />
            The course will focus on US literature produced in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, from the post-civil war era to the years shortly after World War I. The most influential literature of this period stages the questions at issue for American national culture and identity with the rapid urbanization of the population, the closing of the frontier, and the expansion of an already existing ideology of empire. The generic strategies of Realism, Naturalism, and Modernism overlap and contest each other in the works we will read to push back against the massive, anxiety producing influences of pre-Civil War Romanticism.

             78, 379. The Death of the Sun: Energy, Elegy, &amp; Empire in Victorian Literature
            </strong>
            <br />
            Scholars interested in the relation between science and literature have painted a rich picture of Darwin&rsquo;s century&mdash;a time when the social and cultural imagination is dominated by evolutionary biology. But the Victorians had a lot on their minds, and biology was not their only science. Fears regarding the death of the sun&mdash;the extinction of light and life in what was known as the &ldquo;heat death&rdquo; of the universe&mdash;suffused Victorian intellectual and popular thought, and these fears were fueled by a new science: the science of energy. This course explores the ways the ideas of this new science shaped and were shaped by nineteenth century literature. We consider the roots of the term &ldquo;energy&rdquo; in Romantic poetry and in social thought, as well as the ways a strong religious impulse&mdash;the belief that only God can destroy or create&mdash;led to the idea of &ldquo;the conservation of energy.&rdquo; We consider how the idea of conservation went hand-in-hand with widespread anxieties about loss, decay, and disorder&mdash;or what would come to be called &ldquo;entropy.&rdquo; Texts may include Alfred Lord Tennyson,

            </strong>
            <br />
            England in the 1890s was a place of great anxiety about a number of explosive issues. The power of the old imperial regime &ndash; and the stability of the Victorian ethos &ndash; were increasingly threatened by colonial insurrections; advancements in science, technology, and psychology; the collapse of a puritanical sexual order and the emergence of new sexualities; the political and social empowerment of women; various social and economic uncertainties; and the radically new aesthetic politics of the &ldquo;art for art&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; movement.

            <br />
            This course focuses on contemporary Irish playwrights such as Brian Friel, Conor McPherson, Marina Carr, Stewart Parker, and Martin McDonagh in the context of the history of Irish drama as a vital national cultural tradition. From the Celtic Revivalists' plays at the founding of the Abbey Theatre, drama in Ireland has exerted shaping influence on the state as it has also provided a sensitive respondent to tumultuous events in Irish history. More than many cultures, the Irish are haunted by the past, and so we will be viewing the contemporary works as conversations that Irish writers today are staging with their own historical and more specifically their own theatrical ghosts (Yeats, Synge, O&rsquo;Casey, and Beckett at the least).

            This course will look closely at some poets who began to publish in the 1950&rsquo;s and came of age later &ndash; after the passing of the generation of heroic modernists &ndash; Pound, Williams, Moore, Stevens, HD, Eliot &ndash; in the 1960&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. Most of our class work will consist of intense discussion and close reading of poems. We will tackle such themes as the function of poetry in the contemporary world, public and private language, formalism and &ldquo;free&rdquo; verse, poetic voice and its relation to the self, issues of gender and sexual politics. We will consider poetry as a special kind of thinking. Texts will likely include Elizabeth Bishop&rsquo;s

            <br />
            With the destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Cold War came to an end, but the legacy and meaning of the Cold War for the present global scene and for U.S. national culture are still being debated. The central tension between the ideologies, economies, and imagined identities of "the West" &ndash; the U. S. in particular &ndash; and the U.S.S.R. has left its imprint on contemporary culture in many ways.&nbsp; In this course we will study narratives that imaginatively explore dimensions of the forty year global tension in a variety of locations at different moments of Cold War history.&nbsp; The novels, short stories, and films dramatize the history, politics, psychology, aesthetics, and epistemologies that characterized the long-lived rivalry between the Soveits and the Americans.&nbsp; While the majority of the narratives were produced in the United States and England, only some of them confirm mainstream U.S. views of the War.&nbsp; Studying these narratives will help to demonstrate the permeations of the global tension in domestic scenes, in diplomatic and postcolonial situations, in military settings, and in other domains of ordinary life.&nbsp; Novels may include Graham Green's
