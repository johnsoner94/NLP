                The 16 individuals bring a diverse array of expertise, backgrounds and experiences to campus. Their areas of expertise range from labor economics and gender representation on television to black feminist performance to Latin American and African history.
               </p>
               <p>
                "This is a multi-talented and diverse group of ten incoming tenure track faculty. Five of these faculty are teacher-scholars or teacher-artists of color and several will contribute significantly to further internationalizing Muhlenberg's curriculum,&rdquo; said John Ramsay, provost of Muhlenberg. &ldquo;Importantly, some of these faculty bring additional strengths to our arts programs, while others deepen the College's expertise in quantitative departments. I could not be more pleased with these appointments or with the excellent and diverse faculty we have hired into one and two year positions."
