             </p>
             <p>
              Writers seeking work in the television industry generally complete a "spec script," a complete script for an episode of a program that already exists. The challenge is to tell a new story using existing characters without changing any of the fundamentals of the show. In this course, students will study and write a spec script for an existing show of their choice. As with all writing courses in film studies or the creative writing minor, this course aims to develop students&rsquo; creative voices in ways that are applicable to all kinds of writing. We will spend a considerable amount of time thinking about where ideas come from, how we can develop ideas, and the role of creative collaboration in television writing.

              </strong>
              <br />
              While the director is in charge of the creative side of filmmaking, producers are in charge of the business side. Learn how to do this job in this hands-on course. You will be teamed with directors from another class to produce short films in real world scenarios. Subjects covered include working with different people, handling decisions under stress, budgeting, scheduling, scouting for locations, contracts, hiring, and the basics of funding and distribution. Part of your grade will depend on the success of your business decisions. Open to sophomores and above.

             <br />
             Beginning with a survey of the promise and demands, historical, economic, and political circumstances surrounding community television, this course broadens students' exposure to television formats beyond mainstream commercial media. The course examines the history and innovation of community television in the United States and overseas. The course provides students an opportunity to explore how to channel ideas into practice by expanding students' established skills (research, writing, scripting, producing, directing, multi-camera and audio strategies, staging and lighting, postproduction). Toward that goal, the course engages students in the production of a regular series of documentary, narrative, and experimental television and film projects that will be realized during a multi-week intensive studio experience. Multimedia and interdisciplinary projects involving theatre, art, dance, and music will be welcome. There are no prerequisites though it is advised that students have taken COM 230 or 231 Documentary Research and/or COM251 Fundamentals ofVisual Communication.

Using material drawn from the professional world, students will work in a variety of on-camera genres. Genres that may be taught include commercials, daytime, primetime (sitcom and drama), and film. Class time will be divided equally between shooting and viewing, and students are expected to engage critically with both their own work and their classmates. Analytical viewing assignments from each of the genres explored will be required.

              &ldquo;Melodrama&rdquo; does not just mean exaggerated emotion; it is a form of popular storytelling that puts its characters in dramatic situations in which the stakes are nothing less than the victory of good over evil. This course will focus on the prominence of melodrama in narrative film, particularly popular American film, to reveal the flexibility of what some scholars argue is more than a genre, but is actually one of the dominant modes of filmmaking from its inception. The course proceeds chronologically from 1915 through the present. It focuses on films that are often classified as &ldquo;women&rsquo;s films&rdquo; and &ldquo;social problem films,&rdquo; but also includes films that could be classified as action films or &ldquo;men&rsquo;s melodramas&rdquo;― and so there will be a lot of discussion about issues of gender and race. We will also consider how these topics are illus trated throughmelodrama&rsquo;s aesthetics, such as music, dramatic editing, and symbolic use of setting. Meets general academic requirement A

              </strong>
              <br />
              This course looks at narrative and experimental films that thematize the act of travel as a trigger for cultural encounters, which often result in conflicts, power differentials, and individual senses of displacement or disorientation. The cultural encounters depicted include those in colonial Africa, India, and the Americas, as well as post-colonial encounters in new relationship configurations such as migration and tourism. The course also considers as a sub-theme the &ldquo;road movie&rdquo; in American culture and what it says about the relationship of dominant American culture to the land and the indigenous inhabitants. As a theoretical lens, students will consider the cinematic medium as a vehicle for virtual travel and read accounts of film spectatorship that consider particular travel experiences.

              <br />
              "Plays on Film" is a study of the (all too few) successful films made from stage plays, approached in the context of why adaptations of plays to film typically don't, in fact, work. In addition to studying a canon of plays and films, this course will also engage (and contrast) textual, performance-based, and image-based methodologies, and students will be asked to demonstrate proficiency in all three theoretical approaches. This course meets general academic requirements L and W.

              <br />
              This course explores what has been called the "second renaissance" of British drama -&nbsp; "the new drama" of 1956 and after - and the parallel British New Wave of cinema. We will begin by examining the cultural and social influences leading up to the "annus mirabilis" of 1956. We will then trace the emergence of John Osborne and other "Angry Young Men," and the development of a drama overtly engaged with issues of class, gender, and sexuality. We will then look the ways these plays helped to revitalize the British cinema of the postwar era, creating a cinematic scene in which the free cinema and "kitchen sink" films of the 1950s gave way to the bold, taboo-breaking movies of the 1960s. Playwrights may include John Osborne, Arnold Wesker, Ann Jellicoe, Harold Pinter, Joe Orton, Edward Bond, and Shelagh Delaney. Films are likely to include Billy Liar, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, Alfie, Tom Jones, The Servant, The Knack and How To Get It, and A Hard Day's Night. This course will carry the "L" perspective.

As the course proceeds chronologically, it briefly demonstrates images of African Americans in mainstream Hollywood films, but focuses primarily on how filmmakers of African descent have sought to respond to mainstream representations and create their own narratives and styles.

              From the avant-garde to Hollywood blockbusters like The Matrix and Inception, the cinema provides a fertile ground for playing at the edge of narrative, and for testing credibility by constructing alternate logic. When films provide the rules of their own reality, spectators and their surrogate characters grope for a foothold of understanding and sanity. This course explores the phenomenon of film experience within the experience of film&rsquo;s poetic manipulation of &ldquo;reality&rdquo;.

               FLM 354 Film Noir
              </strong>
              <br />
              Dark shadows, low-key lighting, unusual camera angles, flashbacks, a sense of paranoia, and males manipulated by sultry, cigarette-smoking, seductive femme fatales characterize film noir, the only typically American film genre after the Western to emerge from Hollywood. Created during the 1940s and 50s, many by Jewish &eacute;migr&eacute;s from Central Europe, film noir is usually considered a combination of German Expressionist cinematic style and the American hard-boiled detective story. This course will examine the classic works of the genre within their sociopolitical context and investigate why they were so popular among audiences, why they were able to violate some rules of the Production Code, why certain actors are inextricably linked to the genre, and why neo-noirs are still being made.

               FLM 360 Major Filmmakers
              </strong>
              <br />
              This course focuses on one or two major filmmakers and considers repeated and/or developing themes in his or her body of work. While the filmmakers under consideration vary, the course deals with similar questions each time: the validity of the auteur theory as a way of understanding film, the relationships between filmmakers and their art, and the nature of our ideas about art and artistic production.
