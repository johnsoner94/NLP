             101. History &amp; Politics of American Education
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            This course examines the larger historical and sociopolitical forces that have shaped the rise and development of the institutional school in America. Beginning with Jeffersonian America through the late industrial period to the present day, the course traces changes in the political economy and how these changes have influenced educational policy and practice, such as rise of the common school and educational policy debates regarding the appropriate role of education in a democratic industrial and plural society. The course also addresses how schools interpret, translate, and transfer American culture through the overt and covert curriculum as well as public policy by studying the various conflicting aims of education in a democracy. The purpose of the course is to develop the students&rsquo; potential for thinking critically about American education and its institutions in preparation for ethical citizenship and/or educational leadership.

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            This course reflects knowledge derived from theory, research, and professional practice as it covers the physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional development of infants and children (birth-9 years old) and the impact of this study for teaching and learning. In addition to classic developmental theorists (Piaget, Vygotsky, and Erikson among others), students will explore a variety of topics that impact the child as learner at these stages of development, including but not limited to attachment, brain development, memory, fantasy and the imagination, the arts as a way of knowing, play behavior, friendship, the development of empathy, early understandings of justice, the use of public and private space, transition from home to school, and children in relation to authority. Fieldwork is required.

             106, 107. Educational Psychology: Adolescent Learning &amp; Development
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            This course reflects knowledge derived from theory, research, and professional practice as it covers cognitive, social, and personal development and the psychology of teaching and learning. We will use our classroom as an &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; in methods of teaching, learning, and educating ourselves about the sociopolitical contexts for development and learning in American classrooms. The focus of this course is on the developmental changes and challenges that occur approaching and during the adolescent years. We will explore both what is understood as &ldquo;typical&rdquo; adolescent development as well as the ways in which individual adolescent experience may be unique. We will view the adolescent in a range of social contexts (e.g., &nbsp;family, peer group, school, culture) as we consider how issues of diversity (i.e., race, culture, class, gender, sexual identity) impact learning, and development. Fieldwork is required.

           <p>
            This course is designed to broaden knowledge and understanding about students with disabilities and how they develop and learn. Emphasis is placed on the roles and responsibilities of regular education teachers in meeting the needs of these students in order to create positive inclusive learning environments as informed by relevant research. The course introduces the preservice teachers to topics including health impairments, intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, ADHD, emotional disturbance, autism, sensory impairments, physical disabilities, and giftedness. These topics are examined from the perspective of causation, diagnosis, cognitive and social-emotional characteristics, learning styles, early intervention, and differentiated instructional strategies with a focus on meeting the needs of students in the context of the regular classroom. The role of the regular classroom teacher in the referral/evaluation process and working with appropriate school personnel and families is emphasized. Also examined are multicultural and bilingual issues as they pertain to special education. Fieldwork is required.

           <p>
            This course aims to provide an understanding of language and early literacy development of diverse young children (birth to age 9). Theories of first language acquisition provide a framework for understanding stages of oral language development and functions of oral language. The relationship between language acquisition and reading and writing processes are explored through the emergent literacy perspective. Topics in early literacy development include print awareness, phonemic/phonological awareness, phonics instruction, decoding and oral reading fluency, and developmental writing. These theoretical backgrounds inform various instructional approaches to early literacy instruction such as constructivism/whole language, balanced literacy program, and guided reading. This course also offers an overview of children&rsquo;s literature, including an introduction to the genres, notable books and authors, and resources for incorporating children&rsquo;s literature in literacy education programs.

            Student teaching is the core component of the professional semester. As interns in the public schools, students have the opportunity to apply the content knowledge and pedagogical skills gained in their academic preparation to actual classroom situations. Lesson and unit planning as well as assessment and classroom management skills are honed with the support of a mentor teacher and a college supervisor. Daily seminars prior to student teaching focus on differentiated instruction, questioning strategies, lesson planning, meeting the needs of a diverse public school population, and strategies to enhance student motivation. Weekly seminar sessions during the semester provide the student teachers with a forum to reflect analytically on their classroom experiences as they develop their professional skills and voice. This semester consists of two full-time teaching experiences in grade levels appropriate to the area of certification.
