The program pairs Muhlenberg college students with a student from each participating elementary and/or middle schools to be pen pals for the academic year. One letter is written and received each month, with the hopes of promoting literacy, encouraging proper grammar and letter writing etiquette. In addition, Muhlenberg pen pals are asked to promote higher education opportunities to their pen pals by writing about their college experiences and serving as a positive role model.

Muhlenberg collaborates with Cedar Crest College in sponsoring a Second Mile College Friend Program. The College Friend program is designed to provide a context for school-aged youth to consistently engage and connect with positive adult role models. More specifically, this early intervention program pairs "College Friends," collegiate volunteers recruited by The Second Mile, with "Young Friends," K-6th grade students in need of additional support, to participate together in recreational and educational events. To promote the development of healthy self-esteem and personal responsibility, College Friend and Young Friend pairs work together on goals targeting academic and social success, with the Young Friends submitting documentation (i.e., report cards; information from parents, teachers, counselors, or the College Friends themselves; certificates) to verify their progress toward achieving such goals at year-end. As well as volunteering as friends, Muhlenberg student leaders organize the events and recruit fellow volunteers; one leader has consistently been from the football team.

There are fun organized group activities that volunteers can attend with their grandparent and are additionally encouraged to spend 2 - 3 hours with their grandparent a month, doing things like playing cards, board games, knitting, reading, chatting, anything of common interest. In the past, we have had ice cream socials, student performers, movie and popcorn event, and a trip to the zoo with our grandparents.

              Muhlenberg College partnered with Allentown's Jefferson Elementary School in 1990 to encourage the academic persistence and achievement of Jefferson students and enhance the education of Muhlenberg students. The partnership extends from teachers, students and parents at Jefferson to Muhlenberg faculty, staff and students. The relationship between Jefferson and Muhlenberg familiarized the elementary students with a college campus early in life and according to Jefferson administrators has increased student attendance and performance. The partnership has come to include a variety of programs and events throughout the academic year, and the programs continue to develop based on needs and interests, one of these programs in Jefferson Field Day.

              Every spring over 600 Jefferson students travel to Muhlenberg for their annual Field Day. Each class of Jefferson kids rotates through 8 different stations where Muhlenberg students run physical fitness activities and get to know the children. Field Day is a favorite day of the year for both Muhlenberg and Jefferson students. As one third grader states: "I want to go to Muhlenberg when I grow up."

              A committee of students plans a day of raising awareness about various mental health issues including depression. They raise money for local mental health agencies, pass out information throughout the day, and organize an evening event. Usually the event features a mental health professional and a student who has dealt with mental health issues.

              In 1972, students at Villanova University in Pennsylvania recognized the power of education and held the first Hunger Week. This week of coordinated activities has since become the most widely organized hunger and homelessness event on campuses nationwide. Co-sponsored by the National Coalition for the Homeless and held the week prior to Thanksgiving, Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week consists of a series of events designed to educate the campus community, increase community service, and build campus and community coalitions. More than 500 campuses and communities participate during this week each year by organizing educational programs, fasts and sleep outs, community service events, letter-writing campaigns, and congressional call-in days. A committee of Muhlenberg students forms at the beginning of the fall semester and plans events for the week. The events vary from year to year, but have included Faces of Homelessness Panels, Oxfam Hunger Banquets, food drives, volunteer events at local community kitchens, and days of community action.

              Funded by the Trexler Trust and Air Products, the community internship program allows students to work in paid internships with local community non-profit organizations and schools. In the spring semester, students can apply for a 120 hour internship and receive a stipend of $1000 while in the summer the requirement is 350 hours for $2600. Community partner organizations apply to host students as interns, and students apply to those internships they feel best fit their skills and interests.

              Each spring the Office receives phone calls from community partners interested in student participation over the summer. However, most students need to work over the summer in order to pay for their education or related college costs during the school year. In an effort to bridge this gap in service and student involvement, the Office has procured funds to provide a monetary stipend ($2,600) and housing for students matched with participating organizations.

              Scholars in Service to Pennsylvania is an AmeriCorps Education Award Only program (Ed Award). This means that participating students enroll as AmeriCorps members on a part-time basis and receive a partial Education Award at the end of their term. Students who apply and are accepted to the Muhlenberg program will enroll as "minimum-time" members making a commitment to complete 300 hours of service in one year from August to August. Students who complete 300 hours of service during their one year term can earn a $1,132 education award. The award can be used to pay for any legitimate educational expense at your current undergraduate institution or to pay for future educational expenses, as well as to re-pay student loans. Currently, only two AmeriCorps educational awards may be earned be any individual participant.

The chosen Scholars will also participate in bi-weekly (sometimes monthly) group discussions and training sessions focused on the impacts of volunteerism and social justice issues more broadly.

In any given semester we might have between 20 and 30 students employed through our office working in a variety of capacities. Work-study students all have to select 1-2 community-based organizations with which they want to work on a weekly basis. Students also select various projects/programs run through our office on which they would like to work and participate as part of planning committees and leadership teams for these programs. Work-study students also assist with office duties as assigned.
