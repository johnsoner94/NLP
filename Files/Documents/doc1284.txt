Maple St.     Allentown, Pa. 18101"PWR BTTM" is a short documentary about Benjamin Hopkins and Liv Bruce, a duo of queer musicians living in Brooklyn, New York. The music of "PWR BTTM" is rooted in honesty, self-reflection, and the search for truth in identity and performance, both onstage and in real life. Filmed over the course of a week in New York City, the result is a collage of observation, a collection of ecstasy and banality, and a wide gamut of intensity and intimacy. Through candid conversation, Ben and Liv touch upon several important points, such as the importance of gender-neutral bathrooms at their shows to the influence of absurdist theatre and drag on "PWR BTTM"'s navigation of identity. We see the contrast between performance and solitude and how each state of being informs the other. The film closes with an important question: "If your show doesn't make anyone feel less alone, the show's probably not worth doing, is it?""PWR BTTM" was produced, filmed, and edited entirely by Aaron Whitman. We'll see you December 6 for an enjoyable night!
