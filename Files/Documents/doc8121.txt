             HST-101 - Introduction to History: "Democracy in America
            </strong>
            <br />
            When the French aristocrat, Alexis deTocqueville, visited the United States in the 1830s he was struck most by the degree of democracy he observed in the American nation.&nbsp; For most modern-day Americans, however, democracy is something we too often take for granted. &nbsp;This course, which broadly surveys American history from colonial times to the present, will explore the establishment and growth of democracy in America, as well as the significant threats it sometimes faced.&nbsp; Topics, which will variously focus on political economic, and social forms of democracy, include:&nbsp; colonial demography, forms of government, slavery, and the movement for women's equality

             HST-103 &ndash; Introduction to History:&nbsp; &ldquo;Cultural Encounters &amp; American Identity&rdquo;&nbsp;
             <br />
            </strong>
            America has long prided itself on being a cultural "melting pot." Since the time of Europe's first contact with the Americas in 1492, America has served as a meeting place for many different peoples, races, and/or ethnic groups. This course will take a comparative perspective to the process of cultural encounter, and by using a variety of source materials, including first-person accounts, autobiographies, travel narratives, films, and scholarly secondary works, will get students thinking and writing in broad, historical terms about how American identity has been shaped through time by the cultural contacts first Europeans, then Americans, had with various Indian, African, and Asian peoples. Specifically, we will discuss Spanish, French, and English encounters with the Indians in the 1500s and 1600s, American encounters with African-Americans in the 1800s and 1900s, and American encounters with the Vietnamese during the Vietnam War.

             <br />
            </strong>
            This course offers a one-semester introduction to the History of Europe and the development of European Civilization from the late Middle Ages to the present. It will focus on issues and problems in European history and try to explore major trends in the development of European thought and society and the growth of the modern state. After a two-week introductory section examining some ideas of "history" as a discipline of study, the course will spend roughly two weeks on each century from the fifteenth to the twentieth. In the process, we will focus on the Hundred Years War, the Bubonic Plagues and Great Schism of the late Middle Ages, and the concurrent rise of "national monarchies"; the Renaissance and Humanism; Luther, Calvin, and the Protestant Reformation; the growth of the modern state and the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century; the Enlightenment and political and social revolutions of the eighteenth century; the industrialization of Europe and development of nationalistic and revolutionary ideologies in the nineteenth century; and the world wars of the twentieth century.

            This course explores the concept of the American Dream.&nbsp; Students will read a combination of speeches, literature, and scholarly works that illuminate the belief in and pursuit of the American Dream.&nbsp; Selections will range from the seventeenth century through the twentieth century to show interpretations over time.&nbsp; Readings will pay attention to those who have been denied access to the American Dream and those who have become disenchanted with its promise, as well as those who achieved the American Dream.&nbsp; Issues of race, class, and gender will be highlighted

             <br />
            </strong>
            As the Twentieth Century draws to a close, the century as a whole seems to have certain themes: social revolution, emergence of national states, the development of mass wealth and political participation, the appearance and then, seemingly, the passing of global conflict. Why did these develop in the Twentieth Century? Can they be traced to a common source? This course will look at the origin of these developments by examining the impact of the First World War (1914-1918) on individuals, and on the social and political order.

            Who was lionized, and who reviled, by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and why?&nbsp; What did heroes and outcasts have in common and how did they differ?&nbsp; What qualities were admirable or dangerous, and under what circumstances?&nbsp; What can this tell us about these two societies and their cultures?&nbsp; This seminar will try to shed light on the classical world by studying these basic questions through literature (in translation) composed by various Greek and Latin poets, dramatists, politicians, and historians-especially Homer, Aeschylus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Vergil, Cicero, and Tactitus.&nbsp; We will combine an emphasis upon social and cultural history and political philosophy with the close reading of texts and the study of the ancient conventions of genre and modes of public performance.

            Since their invention in the late 19th Century movies have both reflected and helped to shape our understanding of the American nation.&nbsp; Through selected readings in secondary and primary historical sources, and through careful analysis of feature films, this course seeks to explore both how our understanding of American history has been reflected in these forms of popular entertainment, and how the films have helped shape our view of the nation.

            The Mediterranean Sea has long been the arena for interactions between the peoples and cultures of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. This course will explore the changing diplomatic, military, economic, and cultural relationships in the Mediterranean during the Early Modern period. Particular focus will be on the encounters between the Ottoman Empire and its European counterparts.

             <br />
            </strong>
            This course uses the frontier as an excellent perspective from which to study history -- an approach that is particularly useful when placed in a comparative context. The course will first examine the theoretical and historiographic study of frontiers, including Frederick Jackson Turner's "Frontier Thesis" of American history and its critics, attempts to apply Turner's ideas to other parts of the world, Owen Lattimore's work on Inner Asial, and recent anthropological studies of frontiers and colonial expansion.&nbsp; This will be followed by an analysis of specific problems and cases from a variety of cultures and historic periods, including frontiers in ancient Rome; frontier conflicts in medieval Spain and England; the interactions between the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires in the early modern period; European expansion in North America and Southern Africa; ethnicity and identity among frontier populations; and depictions of frontiers in literature and film.

            While the frontier has long been considered characteristic of American culture, cities have, in fact been the site where American culture has taken shape.&nbsp; In spite of a continuing hostility to urban life, American writers, painters, musicians, and dramatists have migrated to the cities where they found a vibrant and sustaining cultural life.&nbsp; This course will look at several cities at particular time periods, such as Jefferson&rsquo;s Philadelphia (l790s), Whitman;s New York (1850s), and Langston Hughes&rsquo;s Harlem (1920s), to explore the close connections between urbanism and American culture.&nbsp; This course will focus on the interaction of politics, economics, culture, and society.

We&rsquo;ll also talk about how such factors as race, ethnicity, gender, and class shaped their experiences once they got here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            </strong>
            <br />
            Nations are often depicted as simply the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; way of organizing human societies, but in fact, ideas about what constitutes a nation and its relationship to countries and governments have developed over time and in response to different historical circumstances. This class will examine the evolution of some of those ideas by exploring nationalism and nationalist movements in the United States, Eastern and Western Europe, and within European colonial territories, in the late-eighteenth, nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. We will read theoretical works by scholars of nationalism like Benedict Anderson and Liah Greenfeld, and use their theories to help us analyze primary texts such as national anthems, museums, bicentennial celebrations, history textbooks, and public monuments. We will consider how conceptions of race, ethnicity, gender, language, ideology and history shaped notions of national identity, and consider how the nation came to play such a powerful role in the organization of the modern world.&nbsp;
