          </h3>
          <p>
           Learning how to conduct empirical research is central to the education of the psychology major. Active engagement in every part of the research process helps psychology students develop systematic, rigorous ways of thinking about people. There are many opportunities for students to be involved in research in the department, and we have excellent
           <a href="/main/academics/psychology/facilities/">
            resources
           </a>
           for data collection and analysis. Students also practice valuable communication skills by presenting research at our in-house&nbsp;

            Psychology Day
           </a>
           &nbsp;each semester.&nbsp;Some student work is also submitted to regional or national conferences. After conducting research while at Muhlenberg, students often continue such work in graduate programs, and in business settings that increasingly depend on their employees to understand people and to know how to learn about them in systematic ways. Scroll through the information below to learn more about the various ways to get involved with a research project in psychology. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.

            Research in Psychology Courses

           Students are introduced to research immediately in Introductory Psychology by

            participating in research studies
           </a>
           being conducted by our faculty and upper level students. This foundation continues through other courses in the major including Psychological Statistics, Research Methods, Sensation &amp; Perception and others. Several upper-level courses require students to develop and implement their own research projects (e.g., Cognitive Processes). Most notably, the 400-level Advanced Research courses serve as our capstone course for the major. Students develop, run, analyze, and present high-quality, novel, and sophisticated research studies, some of which are later presented at regional or national conferences. Click

            Research Apprenticeships with a Faculty Member
           </strong>
           <br />
           A particular strength of the department is the faculty, whose members are not only excellent teachers, but also productive researchers. Many students (freshmen through seniors) work with faculty members as research assistants and collaborators. Students may volunteer their time in a research lab, they may enroll in the Psychology Apprenticeship course (PSY270; .5 course unit), or they may receive Independent Research credit. As a result of these collaborations, students often co-author papers that are presented at professional research conferences, and many Muhlenberg psychology students give presentations at the annual Undergraduate Psychology Conference of the
           <a href="http://www.lvaic.org/">
            Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges
           </a>
           . After an apprenticeship, students also often develop their own research ideas and go on to Independent Research or
           <a href="/main/academics/psychology/seniorthesis/">
            Senior Theses
           </a>
           . For information about the research being conducted by each faculty member in the department, visit the

            Faculty Information pages
           </a>

           <strong>
            Independent Student Research
           </strong>
           <br />
           We encourage juniors and seniors in particular to consider conducting an Independent Research (PSY970). Students work closely one-on-one with a faculty mentor in developing and implementing their ideas. Many of these projects are presented at local or national conferences, and will sometimes result in publication in a psychology journal! Any type of research, but especially independent theses such as these are also very positive additions to a graduate school application. All students in the major are encouraged to present their research at appropriate venues (e.g.,
           <a href="/main/academics/psychology/psychologyday/">
            Psychology Day
           </a>
           ,

            &amp; Graduation Honors
           </strong>
           <br />
           Qualified psychology majors may apply for a year-long thesis program featuring advanced, original research. The program is developmental in that it seeks to offer intellectually curious students an intensive year-long experience of mentorship and collaboration. To be part of this program, students must be willing to invest considerable time and intellectual energy. Students interested in more general research experience are encouraged to, instead, speak with a professor about coordinating an Independent Research project. Successful completion of a thesis and a psychology GPA of 3.7 or better are both required for departmental graduation honors. For more information visit the&nbsp;

           This endowed fund provides students with financial support associated with the direct costs conducting or presenting research. For example, funds may be used to pay the costs of gathering data and information, purchase necessary equipment, computer fees, copyright fees, or travel to conferences to present research results. A preference is given to students conducting research in the humanities and social sciences, followed by students conducting research in the natural sciences.

             Dean's Office Summer Research Grants
            </em>
           </strong>
           <br />
           These grants are intended for students who plan to engage in research or independent study that will lead to publication, presentation, exhibition, or performance. They are not normally granted for participation in formal coursework, formal study abroad programs, or internships. Each student who is awarded a grant will receive a stipend for eight weeks of research during the summer and one course-unit of research or independent study at no cost. Recipients who do research on campus will be provided with campus housing (based on double occupancy). Students may not have other obligations (work, course work, etc.) during the period of the grant. In addition, the student is expected to be enrolled at Muhlenberg the subsequent Fall.

           In Summer Research Collaborations, a faculty member recruits a student as a research collaborator for the summer.&nbsp; That is, the student assists in a substantive way with the faculty member&rsquo;s scholarship.&nbsp; A joint application must be submitted by the faculty member and the student. Each student who is awarded a grant will receive a stipend for either four or eight weeks of research during the summer. Optionally, the student may receive up to one course-unit of research or independent study at no cost. Recipients who do research on campus will be provided with campus housing (based on double occupancy). For more information, speak with a faculty member and visit the&nbsp;

           The National Science Foundation funds this
           <em>
            highly prestigious
           </em>
           and competitive REU Sites program.
           <span>
            An REU Site consists of a group of ten or so undergraduates who work in the research programs of the hosting university. Each student is associated with a specific research project, where they work closely with the faculty and other researchers. This program allows students to experience first-hand how basic research is carried out on a larger scale than ours here at Muhlenberg.&nbsp;Students are granted stipends and, in many cases, assistance with housing and travel. Undergraduate students supported with NSF funds must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States or its possessions.&nbsp;
           </span>
           &nbsp;Note: As you search for REU Sites, be aware that opportunities in the field of psychology are listed under multiple areas, including Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research. Also note that you contact each institution that is offering an REU experience individually to learn about their application requirements, deadlines and program activities.

           <br />
           The ICPSR summer internship program at the University of Michigan provides undergraduate students with a unique and expansive research experience that introduces all aspects of social science research. The program is excellent preparation for advanced studies and careers in data science and social science research. The students, under the supervision of faculty mentors, develop a research question, perform a literature search and review, complete data analysis, and report findings in a poster; learn good data management processes and research practices with a research process mentor; and attend classes at the ICPSR Summer Program in Quantitative Methods.
           <span>
            Additionally, regularly planned luncheon meetings focus on research projects within ICPSR/ISR, ethics in research and data management, and life in graduate school or in a research career obtainable with a Bachelor's degree in the social sciences.

           PREP is a NIH-funded post-baccalaureate training program, designed to enhance the ability of individuals in the biomedical sciences to gain entry to, and succeed in, nationally-recognized PhD programs. PREP is aimed at individuals from under-represented groups in the biomedical sciences who have recently received a Bachelors degree. These individuals will either have relatively little laboratory experience, or will be changing research fields between their BS and PhD courses. This is a year long program with a stipend, health benefits, and tuition stipends. The program web site and online application can be found at:
