              Assistant Professor (tenure-track) -&nbsp;
             </strong>
             Muhlenberg College invites applications for a full-time, tenure track appointment in the field of accounting at the rank of Assistant Professor, to begin August 2017. The CPA designation is required, as well as a Ph.D. or Master&rsquo;s degree in accounting or a closely-related field. A highly-selective liberal arts college, Muhlenberg has developed a thriving accounting major within a department that also offers majors in business administration, economics and finance. The accounting program routinely places more than half of its graduates with Big Four firms.
             <br />
             <br />
             The successful candidate will employ innovative pedagogical and assessment techniques to deliver traditional accounting education within the spirit of inquiry that distinguishes the liberal arts. Muhlenberg&rsquo;s standard teaching load is 3 courses per semester; particular courses taught will depend on staffing needs and candidate interests, but the successful candidate will be competent to teach courses throughout the subject areas that inform public accountancy. Integration of current technology and development of student written and oral expression is required in all courses. Full-time faculty must also engage in professional activity and service to the College. College service requires close collaboration with colleagues and includes the development of mentoring relationships that prepare students for career positions and graduate study.
             <br />
             <br />
             An equal opportunity employer, Muhlenberg College is committed to recruiting and retaining outstanding faculty and staff from racial and ethnic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in higher education. For additional information about Muhlenberg's commitment to diversity and inclusion, applicants can visit the &zwnj;

             .
             <br />
             <br />
             Candidates will submit a letter of application that explains how their qualifications and interests correspond to the requirements of this position and how their contributions will contribute to Muhlenberg&rsquo;s effort to become a more diverse and inclusive community. In addition, candidates will submit a curriculum vitae, teaching evaluations from introductory and upper-level courses, all graduate transcripts, and two letters of reference, at least one of which must relate to teaching effectiveness.
             <br />
             <br />
             These materials should be addressed to the Accounting Faculty Search Committee and transmitted electronically to accountingsearch@muhlenberg.edu. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled, with preference given to those received by November 30.

             </strong>
             Muhlenberg College located in Allentown, Pennsylvania, seeks a Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs (&ldquo;Provost&rdquo;). Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is a selective residential, undergraduate, coeducational, private liberal arts college. The institution enrolls approximately 2,200 full-time students in its traditional undergraduate program and nearly 200 additional adult learners in the Wescoe School of Continuing Education. With an endowment of approximately $237 million and annual budget of approximately $130 million, the College is known for its academic rigor, faculty who are committed to their students, and a close sense of community.
             <br />
             <br />
             As the chief academic officer of the College, the Provost reports to the President and is a key member of the President&rsquo;s administrative cabinet. The Provost&rsquo;s team includes the Dean of the Wescoe School; the Dean of the College for Academic Life; the Dean of Global Education; the Dean of Institutional Assessment and Academic Planning; the College Registrar; the Director of Trexler Library; the Associate Dean of Digital Learning; the Associate Dean of Diversity Initiatives; the heads of 19 academic departments (encompassing 170 full-time faculty); and the Directors of three centers and institutes, and three honors programs.
             <br />
             <br />
             This is an opportune moment for Muhlenberg. Over the past decade, the College has been on an upward trajectory&mdash;strengthening the academic quality of its student body, increasing its number of applicants, wrapping up its most successful capital campaign, enhancing both student and faculty diversity, and completing many capital construction projects. The new Provost will work with the President, senior colleagues, the faculty and the entire College community to further the impact and reputation of the institution.
             <br />
             <br />
             Muhlenberg seeks a strategic thinker who will champion all aspects of the educational enterprise at the College. He or she will enhance academic rigor, nurture the scholarly activities of faculty, foster creativity in the curriculum, shape the long-range academic strategic plan for the College, and strengthen Muhlenberg&rsquo;s identity, diversity and reputation. The Provost will allocate resources to support existing core programs and pave the way for new ones that will help Muhlenberg to thrive.
             <br />
             <br />
             The successful candidate will have a record of proven and effective academic and administrative leadership. He or she will also possess a collaborative, communicative leadership style; administrative, budgetary, and management skills; a demonstrated commitment to diversity; an understanding of effective program assessment; and knowledge of academic technologies.

             The Department of Sociology &amp; Anthropology invites applications for a
             <strong>
              tenure-track position in Anthropology
             </strong>
             (rank open) to begin August 2017. The department seeks applicants who are theoretically grounded and empirically engaged in cultural anthropology. Areas of teaching and/or research that would complement existing faculty include, but are not limited to, medical anthropology, gender and sexuality studies, economic anthropology, critical race and ethnicity and sustainability. Candidates with an ability to contribute to campus-wide general education and interdisciplinary programs are especially welcome.
             <br />
             <br />
             The department expects applicants to be actively engaged in research and publication; however, its primary commitment is to quality undergraduate education. Applicants must therefore demonstrate effective and innovative teaching, and a strong commitment to the goals of a liberal arts education. Successful candidates will hold a Ph.D. in anthropology, exhibit an ability to teach and advise, show promise of continuing scholarship, and demonstrate an ability to work collegially and cooperatively in a combined anthropology and sociology department. While the rank is open, candidates seeking appointment at the associate level must have a teaching and publication record appropriate to a tenured position.
             <br />
             <br />
             Candidates should submit a cover letter that includes teaching and research interests and explains how these will contribute to the diversity of the academic community, curriculum vitae, sample teaching materials with evidence of teaching excellence, graduate transcripts, and contact information for three references. Please send complete application packages to
             <a href="mailto:SocAnthJob@muhlenberg.edu">
              SocAnthJob@muhlenberg.edu
             </a>
             . Review of materials will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled.
             <strong>
              For full consideration, please submit materials before Oct. 14th.
             </strong>
