            <p>
             Some years ago, I expressed to psychology professor James Jackson my hesitation to make any public announcements of diversity initiatives at the College, confessing that they seemed like such small steps on such a long pilgrimage that it would be unseemly even to mention them.&nbsp; He replied &ldquo;you must always celebrate small victories &ndash; those celebrations encourage the community and give your allies the opportunity to cheer you on to greater efforts.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps I have neglected that advice in recent years.&nbsp; In partial correction of that oversight, I share the following list of &ldquo;small victories&rdquo; achieved by many members of our community &ndash; faculty, students, administrators, and others -- over the past decade.&nbsp; I call them &ldquo;small victories&rdquo; not to diminish their importance, but to emphasize that
             <em>
              they are only a beginning of the important work that remains to be done
             </em>
             . Cumulatively, I believe they represent a wide variety of efforts to advance the cause of diversity at Muhlenberg.&nbsp; The list, in roughly chronological order, is not exhaustive and I apologize to any individual or group whose contributions may not be included.&nbsp; I encourage them to contact me with additions to the list so that their efforts can also be recognized as I update this report.
             <br />
             <br />
             The College currently budgets approximately $31 million annually for financial aid.&nbsp; Most of this is designed to support socio-economic diversity in the student body.&nbsp; Financial aid is the second largest item in the Muhlenberg Budget.&nbsp; Only compensation is larger.&nbsp; Over the past decade, the percentage of aid awarded to students of color in the entering class has increased from 13.4% in 2003 to 17.4% in 2012.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              The Office of Admissions began a Multicultural Ambassadors Program in 2005.&nbsp; Approximately 12-20 students per year assist Admissions in recruiting students of color.
             </li>
             <li>
              The Office of Admissions has developed relationships with the following institutions to advance recruitment of ethnic minorities:&nbsp; Prep for Prep; TEAK Foundation; Princeton University Preparatory Program; Secondary School for Research; Brooklyn School for Collaborative Studies; Urban School for Law and Justice; Sponsors of Opportunity; New Jersey Leadership, Education and Partnership; NJ SEEDS (Scholars, Educators, Excellence, Dedication, Success); and North Star Academy (Newark, New Jersey).
             </li>
             <li>
              Enrollment trends from 1990-2012 have shown modest but steady increases in racial and ethnic diversity thanks to the efforts of Admissions staff, student Multicultural Ambassadors, and others: from 6.4% students of color in 1990 to 8.8% in 2009 to 11.6% in 2012.&nbsp; The class of 2016 includes 12.12% multicultural students.
             </li>
             <li>
              The number of full-time faculty of color who report their race on the IPEDS data form has risen from nine in 2002 to fourteen in 2013; a further sixteen full-time faculty currently choose not to disclose their race on the IPEDS data form.
             </li>
             <li>
              Between 2004 and 2012 over $1.2 million in external gifts and grants were secured to support the development and maintenance of support programs for students with learning differences. The number of students with disabilities and learning differences has more than doubled in the past decade, from 102 documented cases in 2002 to 271 in 2012, and the College has added staff and programs in response to these increases, and has invested over $525,000 in technology and renovations to assist students with disabilities.
             </li>
             <li>
              In 2004 Performance Evaluations for all managers were changed to incorporate the following performance criterion: &ldquo;How did this manager&rsquo;s efforts during the past year support Muhlenberg&rsquo;s commitment to function as a diverse, caring, supportive community?&rdquo;
             </li>
             <li>
              In 2004 the College established an Athletic Gender Equity Committee which reviews gender equity in our athletic programs annually.
             </li>
             <li>
              &ldquo;Sexual orientation&rdquo; was added to the list of protected categories in the College&rsquo;s non-discrimination policy in the early 1990&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Same-sex partner benefits have been available to all College employees since the mid-1990&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gender identity&rdquo; was added to College&rsquo;s non-discrimination policy in 2005.
             </li>
             <li>
              In approximately 2005, the College created a partnership with Art Sanctuary of North Philadelphia.
             </li>
